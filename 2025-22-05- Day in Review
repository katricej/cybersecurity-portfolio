Today we really locked in and focused hard on preparing for our upcoming Network+ exam. We spent a good part of the day working through some practice PBQ (Performance-Based Questions), which definitely pushed us to think critically. A lot of the questions were tough, but we tackled them together as a class. It helped being able to break the questions down and at least narrow things down, even if we didn’t always land on the correct answer right away.

By the end of the day, I was feeling a mix of emotions—confused, tired, overwhelmed… maybe even all of the above. It’s clear that I need to spend more time on this, especially in a quiet space where I can really focus and try to work through these questions on my own.

I’m hoping I’ll have time tomorrow and this weekend to get that solo study time in. Honestly, I’m extremely nervous and not feeling super confident about the test right now. But I’m doing my best to stay motivated and keep a positive mindset. One step at a time.
