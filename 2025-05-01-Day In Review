Today, we went on another amazing field trip—this time to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. We had the chance to sit in on some insightful discussions about Artificial Intelligence. Mrs. Jean Harvey Johnson gave incredibly informative talks that really opened our eyes to how fast AI is evolving.

We also joined a session about Microsoft 365 Copilot, led by our host Josh. He shared all the unique ways this tool is being used in the workplace and emphasized how important it is to start using AI now—or risk being left behind. We even got recommendations to invest in monthly AI tools to help build comfort and skill.

I couldn’t agree more. AI is here to stay, and if it can make life easier and work more efficient, then why not embrace it?

To top it all off, we ended the day with a fun bake-off competition! There were so many delicious treats to sample and vote on. Our personal hostess Krista was amazing—welcoming, informative, and truly made me feel like this could be a place I could work one day.

Today was productive, inspiring, and filled with meaningful connections that could help me as I prepare for a career in tech.
