Professional Development Day – Reflection & Takeaways

Today was our Wednesday Professional Development Day, and it was a day full of learning, self-reflection, and meaningful discussions. Mr. Ron started us off with an exercise called the 3+2 Assignment, where we had to list three positive qualities and two areas for improvement about ourselves.

My 3 Positives:
	1.	Organized – I like to be very organized to ensure things go smoothly (or at least as close as possible).
	2.	Time Management – I always strive to be early or at the very least, on time.
	3.	Empathetic – I genuinely care for others and am always willing to help those in need.

My 2 Areas for Growth:
	1.	Patience with Situations – I need to work on being more patient, not with people, but with unexpected challenges.
	2.	Trust in Delegation – I need to learn to trust that others will do just as good of a job when I have to share responsibilities.

A Unique Birthday Reflection Assignment

Next, Mr. Ron surprised us with a Happy Birthday sign and a cake, which left us all confused—until he had us sing “Happy Birthday” and then revealed that it was actually another assignment.

We were asked to imagine it was our 75th birthday and write what someone would say about our professional journey—from where we started to how we evolved. I shared that I wanted to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, eventually transitioning into a Lead Trainer.

From my experience in management, I realized that training and simplifying instructions to build a stronger team was where I thrived the most. I believe that strong training leads to a more efficient and prepared team, and I see myself excelling in that role.

Guest Speaker: Mr. Craig Baltes (Security Leader at Aflac)

Our guest speaker today was Mr. Craig Baltes, a highly experienced security professional with a diverse background in analysis, engineering, and architecture. He also shared insights from his experience in sales within the tech industry.

One key takeaway was his deep passion for AI—you could see how engaged he became when discussing it. He answered many AI-related questions, and I walked away with new knowledge about AI’s growing impact in cybersecurity.

Career Alignment with My Enneagram Type

In another assignment, JW had us research careers suited for our Enneagram type. I am a Type 6 Wing 5, and to my surprise, my research confirmed that my desired career—SOC Analyst—is a perfect match.

Why SOC Analyst Fits My Personality:
	•	I am analytical, security-focused, and detail-oriented—all qualities needed in this role.
	•	The job involves monitoring, investigation, and problem-solving, which align with my strengths.
	•	I thrive in structured teams with clear roles and processes while also enjoying a balance of independent work and team collaboration.

This exercise reinforced that I’m on the right path and that my career goals align with my natural strengths.

Team Assignment: Standing Out & Handling Stress in a Tech Firm

For our final assignment, we worked in teams to answer industry-related questions. My team was assigned a tech firm, and we had to determine how to stand out in a competitive environment.

✔ My answer: Go above and beyond, take initiative, and be consistent and reliable so people take notice.

Another question focused on handling high workloads in stressful environments. My response was:
✔ Delegation – Understanding my team’s strengths and assigning tasks accordingly to maintain efficiency.

However, after hearing different perspectives, I gained new insights. Some classmates had viewpoints I hadn’t considered, and I actually agreed with some of their responses more than my own. This assignment showed me the value of collaboration and the importance of being open to different problem-solving approaches.

Final Thoughts

One of the biggest takeaways from today’s session was career growth and adaptability. Many classmates shared their interest in working at different types of companies—large tech firms, federal organizations, startups, and financial institutions. Primous made an important point: you may start somewhere with a specific goal, but your aspirations can evolve, and that’s okay—that’s part of growth.

Today was filled with great discussions, personal reflections, and new insights into my career path. I feel even more confident that I’m heading in the right direction, and I look forward to continuing my journey in cybersecurity!
