Authoritative- Portion of the DNS where a DNS server holds the official records for a domain or subdomain (zone defines actual data)
Non-Authoritative- refers to how a DNS server handles queries- not to a specific type of zone file
Stub zone- zone used to simplify name resolution between seperate DNS namespaces. Contains only the essential records needed to locate the Authoritative DNS servers
