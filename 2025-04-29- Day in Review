DNS RESOURCE RECORD TYPES

START OF AUTHORITY (SOA)- Primary DNS name server that is Authoritative for the domain or zone.  
Stores: Contact info, Serial Number for version control
Only One SOA
Indicate Authority for DNS zone

Name Server (NS)- provides the name of the Authoritative name server within a nanme
Maintains name space in zones
Can manage multiple zones

IPv4 Host (A)
Host record to resolve a name to an IPv4 address

IPv6 Host (AAAA)
Host record to resolve a name to an IPv6 address

Canonical Name (CNAME)
Alternative name for a particular A or AAAA record
Resolve Domain to Domain names
"Alias" for another Domain name
Computer reads Domain names from Right to Left
EX: www.amazon.com (original name)>>  amazon.com (CNAME)

Mail Exchange (MX)
Identifies a host record that functions as a email server for the domain
Will Always have a (A) record + MX
1)  Create (A) record 
2)  Create MX 
Have Primary and Secondary email

Text (TXT)
Contains Misc info about a Domain
Stores any free-form that may be needed to support other network services
Sender Policy Framework (SPF)- An email authentication protocol used to prevent email spoofing
Authentication method that allows a domain owner to specify which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of that domain
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)- email authentication method that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, phishing, and spoofing.
                                    Verifies that an email was not altered during transit.

Host File
File on host contains IP address to host name entries
Used for tesing purposes



DNS ZONES

Primary (Master)- Zone records can be edited
Secondary (Slave)- Read-only copy of zone
Cache-only- does not host any authoritative zones, but resolves and caches DNS queries for clients
Authoritative- Portion of the DNS where a DNS server holds the official records for a domain or subdomain (zone defines actual data)
Non-Authoritative- refers to how a DNS server handles queries- not to a specific type of zone file
Stub zone- zone used to simplify name resolution between seperate DNS namespaces. Contains only the essential records needed to locate the Authoritative DNS servers

Pointer Record (PTR)
Reverse of A and AAAA 
Resolve IP address to Domain Names

Format of Records
Owner- EX:- www, mail
Class- Ex:- IN (internet)
Type- EX:- A (most common), AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT. NS
Value- EX:- 1..1.1.1, 20001::1:2:7, 1)Mail.com/2)Mail.com

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority- (IANA)
Organization responsible for coordinating key aspects of the internets unique identifiers

TYPES OF DNS SERVERS
Resolver- receives DNS queries from clients (like your computer or phone), and finds the IP address associated with domain names 
Recursive-Contacts other DNS servers (root>TLD>Authoritative) on clients behalf.  Does all the work for the client
Iterative- If it doesn't know the answer, it returns a referral to another DNS server that might know more. Does not do all the work
Caching-Only- only resolves queries.  If the server has the answer in its cache, it returns it immediately
Forwarding- Does not resolve queries, but instead forwards them to another DNS server
Authoritative- server that holds and serves the actual DNS records. Provides final authoritative answers
Primary ( master)- responsible for storing the original copies of the zone files for a domain
Secondary (slave)- read only copy of the zone data from the Primary DNS server. Performs zone transfers from the Primary server to get the latest data
