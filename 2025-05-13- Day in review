Today was a truly inspiring experience. I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer at the CyberRisk Collaborative, and I was absolutely amazed by the number of CISOs and influential leaders in the tech industry who attended. It was such an honor to be in the same space as these brilliant minds—people who are shaping the future of cybersecurity and technology.

One of the highlights for me was how many familiar faces I recognized—and how many of them remembered me from previous events. I’m starting to build real relationships, and it’s exciting to see my networking skills growing along the way.

Much of the day’s focus was on AI and the importance of safety and trust around its use. There were powerful conversations around how AI isn’t meant to replace people, especially not those in entry-level positions, but rather to enhance and support those already doing great work. AI brings speed, cost savings, and efficiency, but trust and ethical use are critical.

One speaker shared a memorable message about resilience—emphasizing the need to focus on long-term solutions, become translators of complexity, and surround ourselves with diverse thinkers. Another speaker tied his message to something we’ve been studying in class: the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). His focus was on Integrity, drawing from the Latin word Integris, meaning “whole,” “entire,” or “complete.” He stressed that trust in AI tools begins with integrity, which really resonated with me.

I also had the pleasure of meeting a graduate from the previous City of Refuge cohort 7 group. I continue to be blown away by the community City of Refuge has built—the support from students, alumni, and staff is so strong, and they’ve truly made a name for themselves.

Being introduced to the attendees and receiving such a warm welcome was incredibly motivating. So many people came up to congratulate and encourage me and my classmate—it was a reminder of how far I’ve come and how much support is out there. I was also able to make some great connections on LinkedIn.

Today was a blessing. I’m grateful I was asked to participate, and I’m walking away more motivated, more connected, and more certain that I’m on the right path.
