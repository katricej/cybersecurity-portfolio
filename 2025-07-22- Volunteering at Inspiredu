Fueling my tech curiosity today! ⚡ Volunteered with the Inspiredu Tech Team and dove into real-world IT tasks.

✅ Mastered the basics of laptop imaging- Windows 11 setups.
✅ Got comfortable with hardware disassembly ("stripping") - removing batteries, hard drives, and network chips.

So grateful for the opportunity to learn practical skills from the experts on the Tech Team. The knowledge I gained was fantastic, and I'm already excited for my next session to keep learning! #TechIsCool #Volunteering #ITSupport #LearnTech #FutureSkills
