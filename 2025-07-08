Key Management
Operational concerns regarding the lifecycle of keys

*Decentralized Management- Each User/Host responsible for key managment
*Centralized Management- Admin/Authority controls key management
--Keys generated and stored on a centralized server

Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)- used to communicate with server

KEY LIFE CYCLE:
1)  Key Generation- Creates strong Key pair with right Cipher
2)  Certificate Generation-subject submits Digital Certificate for signing Certificate Authority verifies identity
3)  Storage- Subject stores private key; Not Lost or Damaged
4)  Revocation- If private key is compromised, Key pair is revoked
5)  Expiration and Renewal- Key pair expires. "Shelf Life".  Renew with New Info

Key Escrow
If you lose the Private Key they have the backup
If key lost/damaged, Encrypted data is unrecoverable

Key Strength Based on:
1)  Randomness- ENTROPY
2)  Key Length

Data States
Data at Rest- Data in a persistent storage media
Data in Transit (Data in Motion)- Data is transmitted over network
Data in Use (Data in Processing) Data is Present in Volatile Memory

Bulk Data Encryption (Hybrid Encryption)
Encrypting Large Amount of Data (Megabytes/Gigabytes)


Why NOT use Asymmetric Key????
Not efficient for encrypting large amounts of data
Overhead is too high

Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
A hardware-based security chip embedded in computers and devices.
Provides secure storage and cryptographic functions to help protect sensitive data like, Encryption keys, Passwords, and Digital Certificates

Hardware Security Module (HSM)
A dedicated tamper-resistant hardware device designed to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys
High security digital safe that stores and protects important digital keys


MS Bitlocker- Encrypt the entire Hard Drive

MS Encrypting File System (EFS)- Encrypts Files and Folders

Structured Data
Stores data in tables, Columns (Fields), and Rows (Records)

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
A security feature in encryption systems that ensures even if someone steals your private key later they can't decrypt past communications
Implementation: Diffie Hellman Ephemeral mode (DHE or EDH); Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman Ephemeral mode (ECDHE)

SALTING
Short random set of characters
Adding unique Random value ("a salt") to each password Before hashing it
Value stored with hashed data field
Hash can not be decrypted
Makes each password Hash Different

PEPPER
Short string added to a password Before Hashing
Adds secret twist only the system knows
IS NOT STORED
Kept Secret

Blockchain- continuing transaction records secured with cryptography

Obfuscation- Making something Hard to Understand on Purpose, so that attackers or unauthorized users can't easily figure out how it works or what it contains

Steganography- Method used to hide data within file (Audio or Image File)
Hiding a message inside something else so that no one even knows the message is there
Concealing information within a different message
EX: Steganography in VOIP

Data Masking
Process of hiding or replacing sensitive information with fake but realistic looking data to protect it
EX: xxx-xx-1234

Tokenization
Replace sensitive data with a Random String called a token that has no meaningful value outside the system
EX: 8NQ59ZZ01
RREVERSIBLE
