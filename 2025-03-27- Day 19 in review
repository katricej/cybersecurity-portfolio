Today was another great day of learning in my cybersecurity journey. We covered a lot of important networking and system administration concepts, along with some hands-on practice installing our vulnerability scanner.
We started with a review of DHCP and its role in assigning IP addresses using the DORA process: Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge. We also covered DNS, which maps domain names to IP addresses, and the default gateway, which routes data between networks. Learning how to check the default gateway in Linux using the ip route or ip r command was a helpful takeaway.
Next, we discussed network troubleshooting tools. Ping verifies connectivity and tests name resolution, while Traceroute shows the path between devices and the different hops (routers) along the way. ARP, or Address Resolution Protocol, maps IP addresses to MAC addresses and stores them in the ARP cache, which can be checked using the arp -a command in Windows or Linux.
We also explored packet analysis tools. Tcpdump is a command-line tool for collecting network packets, while Wireshark is a GUI-based packet sniffer and network analyzer that provides a more visual representation of network traffic.
Another key topic was YAML, a human-readable data serialization language. We compared it to JSON and XML, noting that YAML is easier to read since it avoids brackets like JSON and angle brackets like XML.
In system service administration, we discussed the difference between processes, daemons, and services. A process is a running program, a daemon is a background service, and a service is an interactive program like a web, mail, DNS, or DHCP server. We also went over the Linux boot process, from BIOS/UEFI to systemd, where systemctl is used to start, stop, and enable services. Most service files end in “d,” like httpd for a web server.
We wrapped up with the Cron service, Linux’s task scheduler, and its key components: the crontab config file, cron jobs that define scheduled tasks, and the cron daemon (crond) that runs in the background to execute them.
Finally, we spent the second half of class installing our Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner. After logging into Tenable Nessus and ShellShar.com, I successfully installed my scanner and am excited to start using it in class tomorrow.
Every day, I feel one step closer to my cybersecurity goals. This journey is challenging, but experiences like today remind me why I’m passionate about this field.
