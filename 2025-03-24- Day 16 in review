Today, we started on the infamous networking. This topic has been a major discussion since we began the program, and I was really curious to see what all the fuss was about.
We previously learned about binary, so today we reviewed it to help us understand hexadecimal. Surprisingly, the concept wasn’t as hard to grasp as I initially thought. A lot of numbers can be intimidating, but using charts with number patterns made it easier to follow along with binary and hexadecimal conversions.
We also broke down the seven layers of the OSI Model, which was a huge part of the lesson. As expected, some sections took a little longer to fully grasp, particularly the data link layer. However, learning keywords and key concepts for each stage really helped. The physical layer deals with bits, zeros, and ones. The data link layer focuses on the physical address, also known as the MAC address. The network layer is responsible for the logical address. The transport layer ensures reliability. The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections. The presentation layer handles data format translation, which translates application data. The application layer includes protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, DHCP, SMTP, SSH, DNS, and FTP.
Overall, it was an exciting start to networking, and I can already see why it’s such a big deal. Looking forward to learning more!
