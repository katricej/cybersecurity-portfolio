Today, we covered process management, which introduced us to PID (Process Identification Number). We practiced checking for random processes and locating their PIDs using the ps command. Understanding the different process states was definitely useful. The key states we focused on were running (R), sleeping (S), zombie (Z), and stopped (T).
One topic that seemed to challenge us as a group was working with background and foreground processes. We explored commands like gedit, jobs, bg, and fg, which help manage processes running in the terminal. Using these commands on a live VM was extremely helpful in understanding their purpose. What I took away from this lesson is that background and foreground commands depend on what you need to doâ€”if you want to move a process to the background while continuing to work in the foreground, these commands are essential.
I definitely need more practice, but I now have a solid basic understanding of their uses. Looking forward to refining these skills even more.
