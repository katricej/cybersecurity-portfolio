Today we had Mr. Christian Derricks of EY come in speak to our class. He brought an energy that was unmatched—personable, raw, and real. From the moment he started talking, you could feel his authenticity. He was incredibly open to all of our questions and shared some truly top-notch advice—from how to stand out in interviews to what potential employers are really looking for.

What resonated most was his honesty. He didn’t sugarcoat the journey. Sometimes, he said, you have to take a step back—but that step back can be the very thing that prepares you for the role you’re really meant for. That kind of transparency is rare and deeply appreciated.

He spoke like someone who genuinely cares—not just about the work, but about the people doing it. You could tell he values team collaboration as a way of leading. He’s the kind of leader who looks out for his team, and you can tell they do the same for him.

Truly grateful for the insight, honesty, and inspiration he brought to the class discussion today.
