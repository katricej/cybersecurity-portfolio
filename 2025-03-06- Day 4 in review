A Day of Learning and Creating Habits
Today started off with a surprising statement. I learned that learning happens best when it's hard. I always believed learning should be fun, but today, we were challenged to embrace difficulty. When we learn, we must tell ourselves, this is important because making it important pushes us to grow.

Another valuable lesson was about being appropriately selfish. This means recognizing when to cut ties with relationships that no longer serve our goals and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals, which are people who inspire us and who may even be a few steps ahead of us in different ways, like career wise for example. By doing so, we set our sights on reaching their level one day.

We also explored the importance of testing ourselves immediately after exposure to new material. This helps with retention, digestion, and a deeper understanding of what we've learned.

A big focus of the day was essential life skills, particularly discipline and distractibility. One key takeaway was the idea of being indistractableâ€”learning how to control our attention and eliminate distractions. Curiosity was another skill that stood out, as it fuels lifelong learning and growth.

Creating routines was another major topic. Mr. Bricker shared his daily and weekly routines, including how he structures his calendar and what podcasts he listens to. Having consistent routines helps build discipline and, eventually, solid habits.

Finally, we were asked to choose one indistractable strategy to focus on. I chose "Make Time for Traction", specifically turning my values into time. This means being intentional about how I spend my time and ensuring my daily actions align with what truly matters to me.

Overall, today was a powerful reminder that learning, discipline, and intentionality are key to success. Looking forward to applying these lessons in my journey!
