Security Concepts
Network Threats and Attacks
Spoofing Attacks
Rogue System Attacks
Social Engineering

Threat-Potential harmful event/occurence
Likelihood- Probability/Chance
Impact- Value of Threat ($$$)

Risk- Likelihood and Impact a Threat will exploit Vulnerability
-Threat Harmful Event
      --Manmade Malware
      --Nature- Covid

Vulnerability- Weakness
Likelihood- % Probability (Exploit)
Impact- $$$

Security Audit- Systematic Evaluation of a companys information system security 
--Identifies strengths and weaknesses

TYPES OF AUDITS
Compliance- Verify adherence to laws, regulations, and standards 
Risk-Based-  Identifying and prioritizing potential threats/vulnerabilities 
Technical-  Deep-dive into IT infrastructure

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
Scope: collection/ processing of personal data in the EU

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 
Scope: organizations handling credit card transactions

 Security Controls (countermeasures) 

 Cryptography- study of hiding/encoding data; “Secret Writing” 
 ---mathematical techniques to prevent data from being read/modified

Three main types of algorithms (math formulas) 
1)  Hash 
2)  Encryption 
    --Symmetric key 
3)  Asymmetric key

Hash- Plain Text  >>  #  >>  Hashed Text
Integrity- has NOT been modified, Use comparison to Check
Hash Ex: MD5, SHA, SHA128, SHA512, SHA256
MDA and SHA has probability for Collision
Algorithm executes math calcuation on data (Plain text) to create fixed- length value (cipher- text)
Also called "Check sum" "Message Digest", "One way Street"
Use-case, Secure password storage verifying data
1)Secure     2) Fixed-size   3)Unique

Symmetric Key- Single Key
EX: RC5, AES, DES, 3DES
Encryption Confidentiality
Hide info, Use Key to view
Encrypt and Decrypt

Asymmetric Key- Two Keys (Private and Public Key)
Keys are Mathematically related
Public key- is public to anyone
Private Key- Only person who created key has access to the private key

Assymetric Two Key Process
Starts with Receiver
Receiver creates a pair of keys (Public and Private) 
The receiver sends the Public key and keeps the Private Key
The Sender uses the Public key to Encrypt the message
The Sender sends the Encrypted message to the Receiver
The Receiver uses the Private Key to Decrypt the message 



The States of Data

Data at Rest- encrypted hard drives
 EX: laptops containing sensitive information
 

Data in Transit- use TLS encryption
            --TLS Transport Layer Security - Protocol that ensures secure communication over a network, especially the Internet
Safeguards data as it moves across Internet


Data in Use- Currently being accessed/processed 
Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)- Dedicated hardware chip used to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys

Hardware security modules (HSM)- A physical Device designed to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys



Vulnerabilities- Flaws in software design allowing bypass of security or causing crashes
“Weakness"

Zero-Day Vulnerability- security weakness/flaw in software, hardware, firmware unknow to the vendor, developer, or anyone capable of mitigating 
Vendor has no time to develop patch before attackers can exploit 
  
 Zero-Day Exploit- malicious code/technique specifically designed to take advantage of zero-day vulnerability 
 “Zero Attack” 
 Attacker leverages exploit to: Gain Unauthorized Access, Steal Data, Disrupt Systems(cause damage)

Honeypot- fake system (decoy) to lure attackers 
Purposely leave vulnerabilities open
Appear Secure
Monitored to identify Hacker
ITS A TRAP

Types of Honeypots
Pure- used for monitor purposes
Low- Interaction- Good against bots/automation
High- Interaction

Honeynet- fake networks for broader trapping 
Looks like a real network

Enumeration-  gather info about target

Footprinting- Discover visible layout of the network and its security mechanisms 
 Use “social engineering” or discarded info 
 Collect infrastructure info, employees, & online presence 
 NON-INTRUSIVE-  NOT actually probing the target 


  
 Fingerprinting- Uncover specific types devices/software 
 Analyse port scans, server message analysis 
 Identify system/software versions vulnerabilities 
 Technical details; OS, software versions, configuration settings 
 INTRUSIVE

Denial of Service (DoS) -attack causes a service to become unavailable 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)- coordinated attacks launched by multiple hosts simultaneously 
Overwhelm bandwidth 
Overwhelm processing resource (flood state table)

Botnet-Group of compromised hosts used to perpetrate DDoS/DRDoS 
"Zombies"


Malware- Harmful software disrupting or damaging system
 Types of Malware 
      Viruses/Worms
      Trojan
      PUPs/PUA


Fileless Malware- Type of Malicious software that does not rely on files stored on disk
Resides in RAM
Sophisticated threat, no code on disk, hard to detect


Spoofing- attacker disguises their identity or forgery on source info appears legitimate 
 Someone disguises themselves as someone else to gain unauthorized access to information, systems, or networks 
 Covers wide range different attacks… 
  
 MAC spoofing- attacker changes their MAC address value to a legitimate host, but must disable the legitimate host 
  
 IP spoofing- attacker changes their IP address value to a legitimate host 
 Faking the IP address of another device to mask the attacker's location or identity 
 Often used to mask the attacker’s origin 

 ARP spoofing (ARP cache poisoning)- broadcast unsolicited (gratuitous) 
ARP replies of legitimate host 
Deceiving devices in a local network by linking the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate network member 
Usually masquerades the MAC address of default gateway by overwhelming the legitimate default gateway 

 Email spoofing -send emails from forged email addresses to appear as if they come from known or trusted sources

On-Path Attacks- attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communications between two parties without their knowledge 
“Eavesdropping”  
Generally called Man-in-the-Middle

MAC Flooding- Overloads switch's CAM table with numerous packets of varying MAC addresses 
Causes switch to fail and indiscriminately send traffic like a hub 
TYPES:      Random MAC address flooding, Incremental MAC Address Flooding, and Targeted MAC Flooding

VLAN Hopping- trick target switch into believing that attacker is a legitimate switch 
Evade security that segregates/segments networks 
Hopping from one VLAN to another, attackers can 
Access restricted or sensitive areas of a network 

Rogue Device & Services- Unauthorized hardware and software that connect to a network without permission 
Unauthorized APs, modems, switches, routers, 
SHADOW IT SERVICES
Bypass official procurement processes 

Rogue DHCP Server Attacks -nauthorized DHCP server distribute incorrect network config parameters to clients
DNS Attacks- targets DNS/ invalid mapping of domain name into IP addresses 

 Social Engineering 
 Deception; manipulative techniques 
 Convince someone into revealing confidential info 
       EX: Passwords, Financial details, Access credentials 
 Exploit human vulnerabilities, not technical weaknesses 
 “Hacking the Human”

Phishing- social engineering over electronic communication 
 Send fraudulent communication that appears to come from reputable source to steal sensitive Email / Website 
 
Shoulder Surfing- Observe directly or use technology to watch someone enter personal information 

Dumpster Diving- sifting thru trash to find confidential documents or information that can be used in further attacks 

Tailgating / Piggybacking- Gain unauthorized entry into premises 
       Tailgating – NO Consent 
       Piggybacking - Consent



Password Attacks 

Definition- Attempts to obtain or bypass individuals' passwords using various methods

Dictionary- Attacks Enters all dictionary words.  Targets weak, simple passwords

Brute Force Attacks-Tries all character combinations
       Time-consuming but cracks any password
