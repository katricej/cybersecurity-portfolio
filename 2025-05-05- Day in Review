Security Concepts
Network Threats and Attacks
Spoofing Attacks
Rogue System Attacks
Social Engineering

Threat-Potential harmful event/occurence
Likelihood- Probability/Chance
Impact- Value of Threat ($$$)

Risk- Likelihood and Impact a Threat will exploit Vulnerability
-Threat Harmful Event
      --Manmade Malware
      --Nature- Covid

Vulnerability- Weakness
Likelihood- % Probability (Exploit)
Impact- $$$

Security Audit- Systematic Evaluation of a companys information system security 
--Identifies strengths and weaknesses

TYPES OF AUDITS
Compliance- Verify adherence to laws, regulations, and standards 
Risk-Based-  Identifying and prioritizing potential threats/vulnerabilities 
Technical-  Deep-dive into IT infrastructure

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
Scope: collection/ processing of personal data in the EU

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 
Scope: organizations handling credit card transactions

 Security Controls (countermeasures) 

 Cryptography- study of hiding/encoding data; “Secret Writing” 
 ---mathematical techniques to prevent data from being read/modified

Three main types of algorithms (math formulas) 
1)  Hash 
2)  Encryption 
    --Symmetric key 
3)  Asymmetric key

Hash- Plain Text  >>  #  >>  Hashed Text
Integrity- has NOT been modified, Use comparison to Check
Hash Ex: MD5, SHA, SHA128, SHA512, SHA256
MDA and SHA has probability for Collision
Algorithm executes math calcuation on data (Plain text) to create fixed- length value (cipher- text)
Also called "Check sum" "Message Digest", "One way Street"
Use-case, Secure password storage verifying data
1)Secure     2) Fixed-size   3)Unique

Symmetric Key- Single Key
EX: RC5, AES, DES, 3DES
Encryption Confidentiality
Hide info, Use Key to view
Encrypt and Decrypt

Asymmetric Key- Two Keys (Private and Public Key)
Keys are Mathematically related
Public key- is public to anyone
Private Key- Only person who created key has access to the private key

Process
Starts with Receiver
