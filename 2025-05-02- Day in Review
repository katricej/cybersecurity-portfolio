CIA
Confidentiality- Encryption
Integrity- No Alteration, No Modification, No change
Availibility- The quality of being able to be used or obtained

Availabilty
Percentage of time system is online
Usually expressed as percentage of Uptime in a given year

High Availability
System guarantees certain level of availability
Services are available in the event of some failure
Measured as percentage (100%=zero downtime)
Always ON, Always Available

System of Nines (99.999%)
Refers to system and Network availability
5 (9s) 5 secs/yr Downtime
6(9s) 32 sec/yr Downtime
4 (9s) 52 min 36 sec/yr
3 (9s) 8 hr min/yr Downtime
2 (9s) 3 days/ 5hr 40 min/yr Downtime
1 (9s) 332 days/yr
0(9s) 100% Downtime

Fault Tolerance
Maintain uptime in the case of a failure 
Add Complexity

Load Balancer
A hardware device or Software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed

Load Balance Scenerios
* Round Robin (in sequence) 1, 2, 3 / a, b, c
* Smart LB works in cooperation, Going back and fourth
* Random Select uses different algorithms (2,1,3/3,2,1,)

Configuration Management
Identify and Document All infastructure and devices
Service assests- Things, Processes, People

Configuration Item (CI) asset requires specific management procedures

Configuration Management System (CMS) 
Tools databases collect, store, manage, update, present info about CI

Baseline- Something used to comparte (Starting Point)

SMNP Simple Network Management Protocol
Log Events
Framework for remote management and monitoring of servers and network appliances (such as switches, routers, and servers)
Components:
SNMP Manager- send and receives SNMP messages to manage and monitor devices on IP Network
Process- SNMP Manager>>Send Message>>SNMP Agent
        SNMP agent process message, retrieve requested data >> MIB

MIB- Management Information Base
Hierarchial collection of managed resource information
Records unique to a device
Organize and share information with network management tools

Trap- sent by agents when a fault occurs
A type of alert
Port UDP 162
