Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
Plans that minimize site-wide interruptions to business operations

Business Impact Analysis (BTA)
Identify assets/ processes CRITICALLY IMPORTANT to operations

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Structured approach to resume operations after an incident
Focuses on data and critical system availability

CIA
Confidentiality- Encryption
Integrity- No Alteration, No Modification, No change
Availibility- The quality of being able to be used or obtained

Availabilty
Percentage of time system is online
Usually expressed as percentage of Uptime in a given year

High Availability
System guarantees certain level of availability
Services are available in the event of some failure
Measured as percentage (100%=zero downtime)
Always ON, Always Available

System of Nines (99.999%)
Refers to system and Network availability
5 (9s) 5 secs/yr Downtime
6(9s) 32 sec/yr Downtime
4 (9s) 52 min 36 sec/yr
3 (9s) 8 hr min/yr Downtime
2 (9s) 3 days/ 5hr 40 min/yr Downtime
1 (9s) 332 days/yr
0(9s) 100% Downtime

Fault Tolerance
Maintain uptime in the case of a failure 
Add Complexity

Load Balancer
A hardware device or Software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed

Load Balance Scenerios
* Round Robin (in sequence) 1, 2, 3 / a, b, c
* Smart LB works in cooperation, Going back and fourth
* Random Select uses different algorithms (2,1,3/3,2,1,)

Configuration Management
Identify and Document All infastructure and devices
Service assests- Things, Processes, People

Configuration Item (CI) asset requires specific management procedures

Configuration Management System (CMS) 
Tools databases collect, store, manage, update, present info about CI

Baseline- Something used to comparte (Starting Point)

SMNP Simple Network Management Protocol
Log Events
Framework for remote management and monitoring of servers and network appliances (such as switches, routers, and servers)
Components:
SNMP Manager- send and receives SNMP messages to manage and monitor devices on IP Network
Process- SNMP Manager>>Send Message>>SNMP Agent
        SNMP agent process message, retrieve requested data >> MIB

MIB- Management Information Base
Hierarchial collection of managed resource information
Records unique to a device
Organize and share information with network management tools

Trap- sent by agents when a fault occurs
A type of alert
Port UDP 162


Network Device Logs
Logs- provides performance, troubleshooting, security (auditing) information
Metadata plus event description

Metadata- Data about Data
Date, Time, Category, Event ID

Log Types (System and Application Logs)
System- Startup Events, Changes in OS
Application- Events for single service (DHCP, DNS, HTTP, RDBMS)

Audit Logs
Use of Authentication and Authorization
EX: Sucess/Fail Events

Performance/Traffic Logs
Stats for computer, storage, network resources

Network Device Log Usage
Troubleshooting and Performance
Security and Compliance
Log Management Practices

Log Collectors 
Collects event messages from numerous devices to a single storage location
 “centralized collection” of events from “multiple sources”
Simplify network log management
Aggregate log data into single repository

Syslog
Provide a standardized protocol for sending log messages
 Syslog severity levels
 0 (emergency) down to 7 (debug)


Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Analyzes security alerts from applications and network devices in real-time
        Ex: Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel
Integrates Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM)
