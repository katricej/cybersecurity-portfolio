We started the day with a review of the different classes of IP addresses. Class A includes addresses from 1 to 126, Class B spans from 128 to 191, and Class C covers 192 to 223. There was a question about class 127, and after looking it up, I learned that it’s associated with testing and is never assigned to a public or private address. It refers to the loopback address.
We also clarified that private IP addresses, like those in Class C (192.168.x.x), are typically used for smaller networks such as home or small business setups. Larger corporations, on the other hand, would use addresses starting with something like 10.x.x.x.
What I really appreciate about this class is that we’re learning both the Linux and Windows versions of commands. For example, in Linux, to view the current IP address, we use the “IP” command, while in Windows, we would use “ipconfig” or “ipconfig /all.”
The majority of our focus today was on dynamic configuration with DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). We learned that the DHCP server assigns IP addresses and config settings to client machines from a pool of available addresses. A key takeaway was that the DHCP server IP and the DNS server IP are typically the same. We also discussed the DHCP process, which follows the steps of Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge (DORA).
The last portion of class involved a review of several commands like hostname, nslookup, dig, host, ping, and traceroute. This part definitely feels like it will take some practice to build muscle memory and fully understand how each command functions. I’m looking forward to using these commands more to get a deeper understanding.
