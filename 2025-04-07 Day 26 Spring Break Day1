Spring Break Day 1 – Review Mode Activated

Today is the first day of spring break, but that doesn’t mean I’m taking a break from the grind. I’m using this time to slow down and really review everything we sped through last week.

Over the weekend, I took a quiz. I’m not 100% sure how I did, but overall I felt okay about it. The questions were different from the usual—they were more scenario-based PBQs (Performance-Based Questions). To get through them, I had to really break each question down and look for key words or phrases to guide my answer. I haven’t received my score yet, but I’m hoping that strategy paid off.

Today I started back at Module 1.1 – Network Topologies. Here’s a quick summary of what I reviewed:

⸻

Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer Networks
	•	Client: A device or application that requests services or data from a server.
	•	Advantages: Easy to expand, scalable, centralized management.
	•	Disadvantages: Expensive (server OS, advanced setup).
	•	Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Devices share resources directly.
	•	Advantages: Easy to set up, cost-effective.
	•	Disadvantages: Hard to expand, no central control, security issues.

⸻

Network Topologies
	•	Physical Topology: How devices are physically connected. Think “bird’s eye view” or “follow the cables.”
	•	Logical Topology: How data flows regardless of how the physical network is set up. Think “follow the bits.”

Examples:
	•	Point-to-Point: Two nodes directly connected (e.g., computer to printer).
	•	Bus: All devices share a trunk cable.
	•	Pros: Simple, uses less cable.
	•	Cons: One break = network down.
	•	Ring: Devices form a closed loop.
	•	Pros: Organized data flow.
	•	Cons: One break disrupts the loop unless it’s a dual ring.
	•	Star: All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
	•	Pros: Easy to manage.
	•	Cons: If the hub fails, the network fails.
	•	Mesh: Devices are interconnected with no central point.
	•	Pros: Fault-tolerant, multiple data paths.
	•	Cons: Expensive and complex.
	•	Partial Mesh: Some, not all, devices are redundantly connected.
	•	Hybrid: A mix of two or more topologies.

OSI Model Review (with PDUs at Each Layer)
	•	Layer 1 – Physical: Bits; cables, hubs, media converters.
	•	Layer 2 – Data Link: Frames; MAC addresses, switches.
	•	Layer 3 – Network: Packets; IP addresses, routers.
	•	Layer 4 – Transport: Segments; TCP/UDP, flow control.
	•	Layer 5 – Session: Controls start, manage, and end of sessions.
	•	Layer 6 – Presentation: Encryption, translation (ASCII, Unicode).
	•	Layer 7 – Application: Interfaces with user software (SMTP, DNS, FTP).

Encapsulation: Each layer adds its own header.
De-Encapsulation: Each layer removes a header as data is received.
PDU (Protocol Data Unit): Name for the data at each OSI layer.

⸻

SOHO Networks & PSTN
	•	SOHO Router: Handles both wired/wireless, DHCP, NAT.
	•	Public IP on WAN side, private IPs for internal devices.
	•	PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network): The traditional landline system—copper/fiber lines, switching centers used for phone calls.

⸻

Troubleshooting Methodology (7 Steps)
	1.	Identify the problem: Ask questions, inspect, recreate issue.
	2.	Establish a theory: Use logic, top-down or bottom-up approaches.
	3.	Test the theory: Confirm or rule out the cause.
	4.	Establish a plan of action: Prioritize and prepare.
	5.	Implement the solution: Apply the fix (restart, reconfigure, etc.).
	6.	Verify full system functionality: Confirm issue is resolved.
	7.	Document everything: Findings, actions, and outcomes for future reference.

That wraps up my review of Modules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Even on spring break, I’m putting in the time and effort to make sure I stay on track. Let’s keep going!
