Today was the day our class had to retake the practice test for Network+. I was one of the few who passed the first time around, so I’ll admit—I was initially frustrated about having to take it again. But that feeling quickly turned into perspective. This retake wasn’t a setback; it was another opportunity. An opportunity to reinforce what I’ve learned, to identify areas where I can improve, and to get one step closer to being fully prepared for the real exam.

And truthfully, I did better this time. That felt great.

More importantly, I realized I’m not in this alone. My classmates and I are a team, and if we had to retake it together, then I was okay standing with them. I want us all to win, to succeed in cybersecurity, and to come out of this stronger and more confident.

This whole process is reminding me how crucial it is to stay consistent with my study habits. The real deal—the actual Network+ exam—is coming up fast. I know I need to buckle down and get into some serious study mode. There’s a mix of emotions right now: determination, anxiety, nerves—but also hope. I know I’ll be proud when I finally get to say: I passed.

I truly believe I can do this. I’ve worked hard for weeks, and I’m committed to giving it my all. Success is the goal, and I’m going to keep pushing until I get there.
