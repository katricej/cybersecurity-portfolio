Today I made my first attempt at participating in a capture the flag competition. To be honest, I didn’t fully know what to expect. I originally thought it was going to be a team event, so finding out during the info session that it was an individual effort made me a little nervous. I’m completely new to this kind of thing, but I was up for the challenge and wanted to see what it was all about.

The competition started with several challenges, each worth different points. Each one required a different type of task to capture the flags. I quickly realized where I went wrong — I hadn’t prepared the tools I needed to locate some of the flags. For example, I didn’t have Wireshark installed to analyze packet captures. That made it hard for me to complete certain challenges, but I followed along as best I could.

Even with that, I was still able to capture three flags before I had to stop, which I feel was a good start. More importantly, it was a solid learning experience. It gave me a chance to get my feet wet and understand what these competitions are really like. I know that next time, I’ll come better prepared.

What I really liked about the experience was that it wasn’t just a game. It actually felt like training for real-world situations in cybersecurity. That made it even more interesting to me. I’d definitely like to start with something more beginner-friendly so I can build up my skills and have a solid foundation going into future competitions. My goal is to eventually become a strong contender because I’m competitive by nature and I enjoy the challenge.

It was fun and educational at the same time, and I’m glad I gave it a try.
