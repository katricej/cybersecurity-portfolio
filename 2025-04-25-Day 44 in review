VLANS 
Virtual Local Area Network
Sepearate Network Traffic
Layer 3 Switches allow communicate between VLANs (Inter-VLAN switching)
VLAN uses switch ports to define a broadcast domain
The computers, servers and other network devices are logically connected regardless of their physical location
Can logically create several virtual networks to Seperate the network broadcast traffic
Help with Traffic Management
Created at the switch 

WHY VLANS???? (3 reasons)
Segmentation
Simplicity of Network design and deployment
Easier Troubleshooting and Management

Layer 3 Switches
Layer 3 switches work on the principle of "Route Once", Switch MANY, which many that once a route is discovered, it is Cached with the Destination MAC address, and subsequent communications are switched without invoking the routing lookup.
Operate at Layer 3 & 2
Can route data between VLANs 
More Expensive
Slower
Complex Configuration

Layer 2 switch stores the MAC addresses in its table
Most common type of switch; found in Homes, Small-Med Businesses

Collision Domain
Collision Domain is part of network where data collide with each other
Collisions happen because of HUBS (they are half-duplex)
Switches will only forward data to the intended destination port
If you use a Twisted Pair it wont't be a collision
If you use Coax there will be a collision

Broadcast Domain
Broadcast Domain- Logical group of devices on the same datalink network can reach each other

SUBNETS AND VLANs
Subnets seperate Networks Physically
VLANs seperate Networks Virtually
Subnets and VLANs are used to separate or break down a network into smaller network

STATIC AND DYNAMIC VLAN

Static VLAN is a  Port-Based VLAN that requires Manual assignment of individual ports on a switch to a Virtual Network

Dynamic VLAN is based on a device instead of a port location
Usually MAC-based 
2 Advantages: Flexibility and Security
Flexible BUT more Complex
One port can be a member of Multiple VLANs

Trunking- The process of carrying multiple VLANs over a single physical link between switches OR Between a Switch and a Router
Uses IEEE 802.1Q
Provides VLAN ID for frames traversing between switches
Can be configured between 2 switches OR Between a Switch and a Router

Inter-VLAN routing
Inter-VLAN routing is the process that allows communication between different VLANs in a network.  
By default, devices in separate VLANs can't communicate unless routing is configured
