VLANS 
Virtual Local Area Network
Sepearate Network Traffic
Layer 3 Switches allow communicate between VLANs (Inter-VLAN switching)
VLAN uses switch ports to define a broadcast domain

Layer 3 Switches
Layer 3 switches work on the principle of "Route Once", Switch MANY, which many that once a route is discovered, it is Cached with the Destination MAC address, and subsequent communications are switched without invoking the routing lookup.
Operate at Layer 3 & 2
Can route data between VLANs 
More Expensive
Slower
Complex Configuration

Layer 2 switch stores the MAC addresses in its table
Most common type of switch; found in Homes, Small-Med Businesses

Collision Domain
Collision Domain is part of network where data collide with each other
Collisions happen because of HUBS (they are half-duplex)
Switches will only forward data to the intended destination port
If you use a Twisted Pair it wont't be a collision
If you use Coax there will be a collision

Broadcast Domain
Broadcast Domain- Logical group of devices on the same datalink network can reach each other
