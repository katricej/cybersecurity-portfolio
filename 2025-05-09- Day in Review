Zone Based Security

Airgap
Security measure that physically isolates a computer or network from unsecured networks
Completely  cut off from the internet
NO Wifi, NO cables, NO Bluetooth

Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
Used to improve security of organizations network segregating devices
Perimeter Network (Screened Network)
Divides Network into two parts
Firewall Protection is Forbidden

Zone
Area where all hosts in network have the same security config

Screened Subnet 
Use two firewalls placed on wither side of the perimeter network zone
Protects the Intranet
Always has two Firewalls

Triple-Homed 
FIREWALL/ROUTER appliance with three of more NICS
Achieve same configuration as screened subnet


Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Deployed on network close to perimeter 
Passive System scans incoming traffic
Sends alerts only

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Actively Block or Prevent Intrusions
Takes Action
1) Inspection & Investigation
2) Action- Put them in Quarentine or Simply drop them
3) Sends alerts only


IPS and IDS can be combined with other devices such as Firewalls, Routers, Proxy
United Threat Management (UTM) and next generation firewalls are two examples

Signature- Identifies unique fingerprint (signature)
"Patch Matching"

Anomaly-Based- Seeks anything outside baseline thresholds, alerts, logs, actions taken

Internet of Things (IoT) 
 Embedded Systems 
Special computer that combines CPU, Ram, storage, and I/O for a dedicated function 
System generally is static, which does not allow or require frequent changes 
 Easier to protect and defend against threats 
 Often overlooked by security personnel
"Smart Objects"

Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEProm)
Memory chip store data permanently (even when the power is turned off)
You can erase and Rewrite it with electricity, but not constantly like RAM


Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) 
 • network of monitored locks, intruder alarms, 
video cams 
  
 Building Automation System (BAS) 
 “Smart Buildings” 
 Configures and monitors HVAC, fire control, power and lighting, elevators, escalators 
 Can include PACS 
  
 Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)
 Used to implement PACS and BAS
 Specialized computer designed to operate in industrial settings for automation & control 
 Types Of PLCs: 
 --Compact (fixed) PLC 
 --Momodular PLC 
 --Distributed PLC

Geofencing 
 Geofencing 
 Technology creates virtual geographic boundary around area using location service 
 Software triggers response when a mobile device enters or leaves a particular area 
 Controlling device function (camera and video) 
 Context-aware authentication 
 Applications:
 Creation of virtual perimeters around specific areas (EX: office properties) 
 Restricts a device functions outside the area (Ex: camera use outside the designated area)
