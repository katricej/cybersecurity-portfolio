Today, we had the incredible opportunity to visit Cox Communications, and it was an unforgettable experience! Our tour was led by Hadji Hicks, a former City of Refuge student and graduate, who gave us a truly personalized look inside the company.
The Cox campus is absolutely beautiful, both inside and out. We explored areas that highlighted the history of the Cox family and the company itself, and we were even treated to an amazing lunch—so many great options! One thing that stood out to me was the number of people working on-site. I had expected more hybrid or remote work in a tech environment, but it was refreshing to see such an active, in-person workplace.
When we toured the IT and cybersecurity areas, the atmosphere shifted—it was quieter, with fewer people, but just as fascinating. Another thing I truly appreciated was the diversity within the company. Seeing professionals from different backgrounds, genders, and nationalities reinforced how valuable diverse perspectives are in the tech industry. Being in an inclusive environment like that not only fosters innovation but also allows people to learn from one another in meaningful ways.
Overall, today was incredibly inspiring and motivating. It reinforced my desire to work in a space like this, surrounded by amazing professionals, constantly learning and growing. This experience has given me even more drive to keep studying, working hard, and pushing toward my goals. One day, I hope to be part of an environment like that!
