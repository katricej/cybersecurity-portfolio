Day 1 Networking Review

Today was our first day diving into networking, and we started by building a strong foundation. Interestingly, a lot of that foundation consisted of Linux fundamentals with additional networking concepts layered in. The class session was well-structured, and Mr. Darrell led a solid lecture. It felt like the class as a whole let him take the lead, and there weren’t many outbursts—possibly because not everyone was in class today. This allowed us to focus and absorb the information more effectively.

We also watched some YouTube videos that helped clarify key concepts, making it easier to understand the material.

Key Topics Covered

1️⃣ Peer-to-Peer vs. Client-Server Networks
	•	Client-Server Network:
	•	Centralized management, provisioning, and security.
	•	Clients consume resources provided by servers.
	•	Pros: Scalable, easy to support, centralized control, easy backups.
	•	Cons: Expensive, requires advanced planning, costly server OS.
	•	Peer-to-Peer Network:
	•	Each host can share and access resources independently.
	•	Pros: Easy to implement, cost-effective.
	•	Cons: Hard to expand, lacks centralized control, security risks.

2️⃣ Network Topologies

We discussed various network topologies, each with different structures and use cases:
	•	Point-to-Point: Direct connection between two nodes.
	•	Bus: Devices connect via a trunk cable, and all messages are sent to all devices.
	•	Ring: Devices form a closed loop where data moves in one direction.
	•	Star: All devices connect to a central hub/switch, which transmits data.
	•	Mesh: Each node connects to multiple others for redundancy (fault tolerance is key).
	•	Hybrid: A mix of multiple topologies, making it complex but flexible.

We also distinguished between:
	•	Physical Topology (bird’s-eye view of cables/devices).
	•	Logical Topology (how data actually moves through the network).

3️⃣ OSI Model & Troubleshooting

We reviewed the seven OSI layers:
	1.	Physical
	2.	Data Link
	3.	Network
	4.	Transport
	5.	Session
	6.	Presentation
	7.	Application

We also discussed encapsulation and decapsulation, reinforcing how data flows through these layers.

Finally, we covered the troubleshooting methodology:
	1.	Identify the problem.
	2.	Establish a theory of probable cause.
	3.	Test the theory.
	4.	Establish a plan of action.
	5.	Implement the solution.
	6.	Verify the solution.
	7.	Document everything.

We wrapped up with Practice-Based Questions (PBQs) to prep for the Network+ exam, which really pushed us to think critically.

Clark Atlanta Visit

In the second half of the day, we went to Clark Atlanta for a lecture. Unfortunately, there was some miscommunication about registration, and it didn’t seem like they were prepared for us. Since the event was optional, I returned to school and worked on more PBQs, which were extremely helpful for understanding the types of questions we’ll face on the exam.

Overall, today was a strong start. The structured learning environment helped us focus, and I feel like I’m starting to build a solid networking foundation. Looking forward to diving deeper!
