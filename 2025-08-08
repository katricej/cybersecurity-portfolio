### **IMG_9238.jpeg**  
**Date:** 8-8-2025  
**Topic:** Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Collect logs (data from firewalls, servers, computers).  
  - Detect threats (suspicious activity, hacking attempts).  
  - Alert the team.  
  - Investigate problems.  
- **Agent-based:** Install software (agent) on each host.  
- **SIEM = SIM + SEM**  
  - **SIM (Security Information Management):**  
    - Stores and analyzes historical data (logs).  
    - Helps with compliance/audits and forensic investigations.  
    - Example: Looking back at login records to investigate a breach.  
  - **SEM (Security Event Management):**  
    - Real-time monitoring and alerting.  
    - Detects and responds to threats as they happen.  
    - Example: Alerting when someone accesses a system from a blacklisted IP.  
- **Agentless / Collector:**  
  - No agent software required.  
  - (Report-less)  
  - Beats in ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  
- **Popular SIEM Tools:**  
  - Splunk  
  - IBM QRadar  
  - Microsoft Sentinel  
- **Input to SIEM:**  
  - Logs  
  - NDR (Network Detection and Response)  
  - Threat Intel  
  - EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)  
  - Vulnerabilities  
- **Limitations:**  
  - EDR, other SIEMs, or logs = SIEM Gap (incomplete coverage).  
- **Top Developments:**  
  - **Federated Search:**  
    - Searching across multiple data sources/systems simultaneously from one place.

### **IMG_9241.jpeg**  
**Date:** 8-8-2025  
**Topic:** Malware Classification  
- **Virus:**  
  - Modifies a host file to spread (documents/programs).  
  - Spreads when infected files are opened.  
  - Damages files or slows systems.  
- **Worm:**  
  - Self-spreading through networks (no user action needed).  
  - Used to slow networks or install more malware.  
- **RAT (Remote Access Trojan):**  
  - Disguised as safe files/software.  
  - Gives hackers remote access to systems.  
- **Spyware:**  
  - Monitors user activity and sends data to attackers.  
- **Adware:**  
  - Displays excessive ads (pop-ups, banners, browser redirects).  
- **Keylogger:**  
  - Records keystrokes to steal credentials.  
- **Ransomware:**  
  - Locks files/systems and demands payment.  
- **Rootkit:**  
  - Hides deep in systems to maintain hidden access.  
- **Logic Bomb:**  
  - Dormant malicious code that activates when conditions are met.

### **IMG_9239.jpeg**  
**Topic:** SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)  
- **Purpose:** Automate threat response (faster/efficient).  
- **Components:**  
  - **S**ecurity Orchestration: Connects tools/systems.  
  - **A**utomation: Executes tasks automatically (e.g., dynamic playbooks).  
  - **R**esponse: Takes action against threats.  
- **Tools:** Palo Alto, IBM Resilient, Splunk Phantom.  
- **XDR + SOAR = Complete Security Setup**  
- **Threat Hunting (Proactive):**  
  - Searches for hidden threats (e.g., in dark web).  
- **Key Metrics:**  
  - MTTR (Mean Time to Respond) = 70% reduction.  
- **Orchestration:**  
  - Connects tasks/tools into a workflow (e.g., Detect → Block → Alert → Report).  
- **Automation:**  
  - Performs tasks without human intervention (e.g., block an IP automatically).

### **IMG_9243.jpeg**  
**Date:** 8-8-2025  
**Topic:** Passwords & Network Threats  
- **Brute Force Attack:**  
  - Hackers try every password combination.  
  - **Defense:** Strong long passwords + MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).  
- **Password Spraying (Online):**  
  - Tests a few common passwords (e.g., "Password123") across many accounts.  
  - Avoids account lockouts by targeting multiple users.  
- **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification):**  
  - Uses radio waves to track objects (tags/readers).  
  - Examples: Access cards, badges, key fobs.  
- **DoS (Denial of Service):**  
  - Floods a target with excessive traffic (slows/crashes it).  
  - Originates from one computer.  
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):**  
  - Floods targets using many compromised devices.  
- **Evil Twin:**  
  - Fake Wi-Fi network mimicking legitimate ones to steal data.
