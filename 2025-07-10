Data Protection
**Tokenization**
- Replaces sensitive data with random tokens (no intrinsic meaning).  

**Data Masking**  
- Hides real data with fake but realistic values (e.g., `@xxx.xx/237`).  

**Database Schema**  
- Blueprint for organizing data in a database.

Identity & Access Management (IAM)  
**Authentication**: Verify identity ("Who are you?").  
  - Factors: Knowledge (password), possession (token), biometrics, location.  
**Authorization**: Assign permissions ("What can you do?").  
**Accounting**: Audit logs ("What did you do?").  

**Password Policies**  
**Length/Complexity**: Minimum length, mix of characters.  
**Age/History**: Expiration, prevent reuse of old passwords.

Security Metrics  
-**False Positive**: Legitimate action flagged as malicious.  
-**False Negative**: Malicious action missed.  
-**False Rejection Rate (FRR)**: Valid users rejected.  
-**False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**: Invalid users accepted.  
-**Crossover Error Rate (CER)**: Balance point where FRR = FAR.

Authentication Methods  

**One-Time Passwords (OTP)**  

**HOTP**: Hash-based OTP (uses counter + secret key).  

**TOTP**: Time-based OTP (expires in 30-60 sec).  

**Hardware Tokens**  
-Physical devices (e.g., YubiKey) or SMS/email-based OTPs.  

**Software Tokens**  
-Generated by identity providers (e.g., Google Authenticator).  
-**FIDO**: Uses PKI for device-based auth.  

---

Privilege Management  
**Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**  
Grant minimum permissions needed.  

**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
-Logs access to sensitive systems.  
**SAWs**: Isolated admin workstations.  

**Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP)**  
Temporary credentials destroyed after use.  

---

Access Control Models  
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
-Rights based on job roles.  

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
-Decisions based on user/resource attributes.  

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**  
Owner-controlled permissions (ACLs).  

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**  
-Government/military use ("need-to-know").
