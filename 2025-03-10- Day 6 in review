Today marked the first day of diving into the official technical coursework, and it was a great start! We kicked things off by covering the absolute basics like what is a computer, discussed its parts, software vs. hardware, and operating systems. It was refreshing to have the class approach these foundational concepts from the ground up. With everyone coming into the program at different levels of tech knowledge, Mr. Darryl made sure to provide a solid foundation so that we could all get on the same page. His approach was ensured that no one was left behind, and by the end of the class, I felt like I had a clearer understanding of how computers work. I'm looking forward to building on this foundation as we continue our journey!  I also liked how well the class worked together.  We all seemed to help each other where and when we could.
