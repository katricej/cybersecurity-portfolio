Today we learned about virtualization.  It seemed like that was the more difficult topic of the day to grasp.  I think a lot of us were overthinking it.  Then we talked about virtual machines.  I think Mr. Darryl did a good job of staying on the virtualization portion so be could better understand about the virtual machines.  I came up with pizza analogy for me to understand virtualization.   The pizza is the computer, the slices are the virtual machines and the toppings are the specific items you want to be included on your virtual machine.  We also went over Binary numbers.  And I can say after using Mr. Darryl’s system I understood it better.  He made sure we used several examples to help understand the concept.  We ended with trying to install our virtual machine but majority of the class had to try it later because it took a long time to download.  I had a good day of learning and I’m ready for tomorrow!
