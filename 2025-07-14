Enterprise Network Architecture

Data Plane- Moving packets (Physical0 1s& 0s 
Ex: Firewall, Switch, Router

Control Plane- Routing/Forward
IPv4 IPv6

Management Plane- Configure the device ; Administration; Make changes

Network Segmentation
Creating sub-networks in a network
Dividing a computer network into smaller parts to make it safer and more organized
* Organization
* Reducing Size of Broadcast Domains
* Enhancing Security

Network Segmentation Techniques:
Physical Segmentation- Different Switches, Routers, Cables
                       Uses Hardware, seperate devices
Virtual Segmentation- VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
                      Logically using software



Security Zones
Segment containing hosts with same access control and security requirements
Three Zones:
Internet (untrusted)
DMZ (Semi-Trusted)
Internal Network ( Trusted)

Screened Subnet- is a more secure version of a DMZ

Multi-homed- a device or network that is connected to two or more networks at the same time


Ad hoc Network ("or this")
A decentralized network
Temporary wireless network created without any central device (like a router or access point)

Attack Surface- POINTS where threat actor can gain access



IEEE 802.1X
Network securtity standard that controls WHO can connect to a network- whether its Wired or Wireless
A netowrk access control standard developed by the Instistute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
Provides framework for Authenticating devices or users trying to access a network

Network Access Control (NAC)
A security system that controls WHO and WHAT is allowed to connect to a network
1) WHO you are
2) What device You're using
3) If Your Device is SAFE


Port Security
A feature on Network Swithches that controls which devices can connect to a specific physical port
Restricts Network access on a switch port to specific devices based on their MAC addresses
Physical Port security- Limit Physical Access

Air gapped
Host not Physically connected to ANY Network
Physically isolated - it is NOT connected to the internet or any other network
Can use ElectroMagnetic Wave Power to gain access/bypass air gap --Ethernet Over Power

Extensible Authentiction Protocol (EAP) 
Commonly used on Wireless networks (WPA/WPA2)
Framework used for Network Access Authentication
Likes- Passwords/Questions, Certificates(Public Key), Token(Key fob)


Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
A Deterrent Control- because AUP doesn't stop users technology but it Discourages bad behavior by setting rules and consequences


Agent-Based- Software installed/ Active
Agent-Less- NO Software installed /Passive


Test Access Point (TAP)
Copies all Network traffic
Monitors traffic



Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)
Port-Mirroring
Feature of network switch that copies traffic from one port (or multiple ports) and sends it to another port where monitoring device is connected



Fail-Open
IF something fails or loses power, the system OPENS the path so things can keep moving

Fail-Close (Fail secure)
If something fails, the system CLOSES or Locks the path to stop access



Firewall 
Filters Traffic

TYPEs:
Stateless- Looks at one Packet at a time.
EX: Source address| Destination Address| Version Ipv6 or 4| Port Number

Statefull- Looks at the Conversation

Hostbased- Runs of single host
EX: Defender, McAfee, Symantec

Network Based- run software on host (Protects the Network)
EX: PFSense, Cisco

Application Firewall- runs on a server to protect particular application

Network Operating System (NOS)- Firewall that runs under network Server OS

Layer 4 Firewall- TCP 3-way handshake.  Uses TCP and UDP

Layer 7 Firewall- Focuses on the Application. Inspect headers and payloads of application layer packets.
                  EX: HTTPS, HTTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, Database(MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL)


Proxy Server
Works as "Store and Forward: Model
Looks at Web traffic, Email traffic, Database traffic
*Application specific
Does NAT(Natting) Network Access Translation Private-->Public
Caching (in Memory)

Forward Proxy- Traffic going OUTBOUND
Reverse Proxy- Traffic coming INBOUND



Unified Threat Management (UTM)
All in one security appliance box
Centralizes firewall antivirus NIPS, Spam Filtering, Content Filtering, Data Lose Prevention, VPN, Cloud Access Gateway
Ideal for Branch Office

Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Tracks the state of traffic based on Layer 2-7
Combine application aware filter with user account based filter


Load Balancing
Distributes requests acreoss farm or pool of servers
*Round Robin (123, 123), First in First Out (FIFO)
*Weighting - Assign RATIO to server



Clustering
Distributes client traffic over two or more nodes
Active-Active spreads workload avoids idleness and overload
Active-Passive- if Node fails all client traffic goes to Passive mode
