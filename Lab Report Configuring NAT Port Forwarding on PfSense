🧪 Lab Report: Configuring NAT Port Forwarding on pfSense

Lab Title: 5.3.4 Lab – Configure NAT
Your Role: IT Administrator
Objective: Allow remote access from LAN to DMZ devices using NAT port forwarding in pfSense.

⸻

📝 Scenario

As the network administrator for a small corporate environment, you need to manage several systems in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) from your internal LAN network. To accomplish this securely, you’ll configure NAT (Network Address Translation) port forwarding rules on a pfSense firewall, allowing specific remote management protocols to pass through.

⸻

🔧 Lab Environment
	•	pfSense Management URL: http://198.28.56.22
	•	Username: admin
	•	Password: P@ssw0rd
	•	DMZ Devices:
	•	PC1: 172.16.1.100 (Windows)
	•	Kali Linux Server: 172.16.1.6
	•	Web Server: 172.16.1.5

⸻

🎯 Goals

You will create three NAT port forwarding rules:
	1.	Allow RDP (port 3389) from LAN to PC1
	2.	Allow SSH (port 22) from LAN to Kali Linux
	3.	Allow RDP (custom port 5151) from LAN to Web Server

⸻

🛠️ Procedure and Explanation

✅ Step 1: Log in to pfSense
	•	Navigate to: http://198.28.56.22
	•	Enter credentials:
	•	Username: admin
	•	Password: P@ssw0rd

Why: You need access to pfSense’s web interface to create NAT and firewall rules.

⸻

✅ Step 2: NAT Rule – RDP to PC1
	•	Target IP: 172.16.1.100
	•	Protocol: TCP
	•	Port: 3389
	•	Description: RDP from LAN to PC1

How to configure:
	1.	Go to Firewall > NAT > Port Forward
	2.	Click Add (+)
	3.	Interface: LAN
	4.	Protocol: TCP
	5.	Destination Port Range: 3389
	6.	Redirect target IP: 172.16.1.100
	7.	Redirect target port: 3389
	8.	Description: RDP from LAN to PC1
	9.	Save and apply

Why: Allows remote desktop access from inside the LAN to PC1 in the DMZ.

⸻

✅ Step 3: NAT Rule – SSH to Kali Linux
	•	Target IP: 172.16.1.6
	•	Protocol: TCP
	•	Port: 22
	•	Description: SSH from LAN to Kali

How to configure:
	1.	Add a new NAT rule
	2.	Interface: LAN
	3.	Protocol: TCP
	4.	Destination port: 22
	5.	Redirect target IP: 172.16.1.6
	6.	Redirect target port: 22
	7.	Description: SSH from LAN to Kali
	8.	Save and apply

Why: Enables secure terminal access to the Kali server using SSH from the LAN.

⸻

✅ Step 4: NAT Rule – RDP to Web Server (Custom Port)
	•	Target IP: 172.16.1.5
	•	Custom Port (LAN side): 5151
	•	Redirect to Port: 3389
	•	Description: RDP from LAN to web server using custom port

How to configure:
	1.	Add another NAT rule
	2.	Interface: LAN
	3.	Protocol: TCP
	4.	Destination Port Range: 5151
	5.	Redirect target IP: 172.16.1.5
	6.	Redirect target port: 3389
	7.	Description: RDP from LAN to web server using custom port
	8.	Save and apply

Why: Adds remote access to the web server using a custom port (5151), improving security through port obfuscation while maintaining full RDP functionality.

⸻

🔁 Step 5: Confirm Firewall Rules
	•	Navigate to Firewall > Rules > LAN
	•	Verify that rules were auto-created
	•	Ensure they match the NAT rules above

Why: NAT port forwarding alone is not enough — traffic must be allowed by firewall rules, which pfSense often creates automatically. Always verify!

⸻

✅ Results / Verification

After configuring each rule:
	•	Use RDP from LAN to access:
	•	PC1 via 3389
	•	Web Server via 5151
	•	Use SSH to connect to:
	•	Kali Linux on port 22

Each service should now be reachable from the LAN while still respecting the DMZ’s isolation.

⸻

🧠 Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how to:
	•	Configure NAT port forwarding for secure LAN-to-DMZ communication
	•	Use standard and custom ports to manage devices
	•	Balance accessibility with security via pfSense firewall

By completing these steps, you’ve gained practical experience in creating a segmented but accessible enterprise network using pfSense.
