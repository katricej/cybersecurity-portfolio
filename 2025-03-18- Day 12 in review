Today was a somewhat confusing day. We went over permissions, and while it didn’t seem like it should have been so involved, the different commands really threw me off. We had to convert permissions into read, write, and execute values in numerical form, which took some time to grasp.
That was just the first half of the day. The second half focused on special permissions and the umask command. We also watched a YouTube video, but at that point, it seemed like everyone was either extremely tired or struggling to fully understand the material. I personally found myself confused—not with the calculations, but with the actual purpose and function of some of the concepts, especially SUID and the sticky bit.
By the end of the day, I was at least able to recognize permissions by their output, but overall, it was a long and challenging day. I pushed through as best as I could, but I know I’ll need to go home and study—reviewing notes, examples, and commands—to make sure everything sticks a little better.
