Today was Professional Development Wednesday, and we had the opportunity to hear from Mr. Edwin Katabaro, the current Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at Turing. Turing is a late-stage startup focused on AI innovation. According to their website (www.turing.com), they bridge cutting-edge research with practical deployment, powering breakthroughs in AI reasoning, problem-solving, and coding capabilities.

From the moment Mr. Katabaro began speaking, I noticed his calm and mellow demeanor—something that really stood out, especially considering the high-stress nature of his role. He came well-prepared with a PowerPoint presentation, which made a strong impression. He mentioned being a Type A planner, which I could relate to as someone who values structure and organization.

During his talk, he shared a bit about his personal life and career timeline. His experience includes roles such as Senior IT Program Manager, Disaster Recovery Director, IAM Security Director, and now CISO. It was insightful to see the progression of his career and how each role helped shape his journey.

He also offered some valuable advice, including the importance of choosing a supportive spouse, networking for future opportunities, and giving back to the community—he personally volunteers with Habitat for Humanity. One simple but powerful reminder he gave was to live within your means and save for retirement.

When discussing interviews, he emphasized researching the role and company, staying current on technology trends, tailoring your resume to specific positions, and practicing often to build confidence. He mentioned that analytical thinking is a strong transferable skill. He also pointed out red flags in interviews, such as being unprepared to answer basic questions about the company, poor eye contact, and giving unfocused or rambling responses.

I asked him two questions. First, given how relaxed he seems, would he still choose to become a CISO knowing what he knows now, and does he see himself growing in that space? He admitted the role can be stressful, but he stands by his choice and wants to continue growing in it. My second question was about the role of AI and whether there’s space for entry-level professionals like us. He said absolutely—AI still needs people to manage, implement, and configure tools. It’s important to understand the framework and be able to speak about the tools intelligently.

Mr. Katabaro was knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and genuinely passionate about giving back. It was refreshing to hear from someone so accomplished who carries himself with such calm and humility. I’m truly grateful for people like him who make time to encourage and support students like us.
