Town Hall Meeting with Jeanie and Jahari (Answers were not all my personal opionion)
Successes, Challenges, Resources Sharing, Aspirations, and Support
The Successes were passing the Linux Test, Speakers coming in the class, Networking opportunities, and Tech skill development
Aspirations- Certifications
Challenges- Time constraints, Pace of course, Last minute schedules or tasks
Resource Sharing- Networking Events
My personal suggestion was that we focus more on Mock Interview prep, Resume help (which we did last week), I would like to work on Projects to gain more hands on experience to add for my resume
