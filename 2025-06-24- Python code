Chapter 6 Labs: Files 
 
1.You currently work as a Help Desk Assistant and your boss has requested 
you create code that will write “known good spare” parts into a text file. 
The parts should be saved in a file called helpdesk.txt. The parts needed 
are: motherboard, DDR4 RAM, PSU, and SATA drive. Each part should 
appear on a separate line. Create code that will allow you to write and read 
helpdesk.txt. 
 
 
def main():

    num_tools = int(input("How many good parts you got? : "))
    openfile = open('helpdesk.txt', 'w')
    for count in range (1,num_tools +1):
        tool = input(f'What is the name of the tool? {tools}')
        openfile.write(str(tool) * '\n')
    openfile.close()
    print('The tools have been written to helpdesk.txt')

    openfile = open('helpdesk.txt', 'r')
    print(openfile.read())
    openfile.close()

main()
    



 
2.A co-worker told you that several spare parts were not included in the 
helpdesk.txt file. The critical parts missing are: SATA cable, CPU heatsink, 
and NIC.  Include the three spare parts to the helpdesk.txt file. Ensure the 
additional parts are included in the file and on separate lines. 
 

def main():

    print('SATA cable, CPU heatsink, NIC')
    missing_parts = int(input('Enter missing parts: '))
    openfile = open('helpdesk.txt', 'a')
    for count in range (1, missing parts +1):
        parts = input(f'What is the missing part? {count} ')
        openfile.write(str(parts) + '\n')
    openfile.close()
    openfile = open('helpdesk.txt', 'r')
    print(openfile.read())
    openfile.close()
   

main()




2.1Your new boss wants the code to ask the user to enter new spare parts. 
Include two new spare parts into the helpdesk.txt file. But this time, 
prompt the user to enter these parts: keyboard and mouse. Ensure the 
additional parts are included in the file and on separate lines. 
 
def main():
    infile = open('winbuild.txt', 'w')
    print("Enter your Windows build number")
    build_num = float(input("Win build number: "))

    infile.write(str(build_num))
    infile.close()
    print('The Windows build number was written to winbuild.txt')

    outfile = open('winbuild.txt', 'r')

    read_file = outfile.read()
    outfile.close()
    print(read_file)

main()
    
    





 
3.Write a python code that writes your device’s Windows 10/11 build number 
into a text file called winbuild.txt. REMEMBER: you are not the only one to 
use this this code! Write code that will allow you to read winbuild.txt. 
HINT: numbers can not be written into text file; only string characters 
 


 def main():
    infile = open('winbuild.txt', 'w')
    print("Enter your Windows build number")
    build_num = float(input("Win build number: "))

    infile.write(str(build_num))
    infile.close()
    print('The Windows build number was written to winbuild.txt')

    outfile = open('winbuild.txt', 'r')

    read_file = outfile.read()
    outfile.close()
    print(read_file)

main()
    
    





 
4.The security director requires you to create a program that records the 
number of network cyber-attacks during a series of days. Enter the number 
of days of recorded attacks and write the daily amounts into a text file 
called cyberattack.txt. Write code that will allow you to read 
cyberattack.txt and display the total number of attacks. 



def main():
    cyber_attacks = int(input('Enter the number of days of recorded attacks: '))

    infile = open('cyber_attacks.txt', 'w')
    total_attacks = 0
    for count in range(1, cyber_attacks +1):
        daily_attacks = int(input(f'How many attacks on day {count}'))
        total_attacks = total_attacks + daily_attacks
        infile.write(str(daily_attacks) + '\n')
    infile.close()
    print('The total number of cyber attacks are {total_attacks}')
                              
   

    infile.open('cyber_attacks.txt', 'r')
    print(infile.read())
    infile.close()

main()


Chapter 6 Homework: Files 
 
1.You are a Security Engineer at SNOW (synonym for ICE ), and you are tasked 
to create a python code that will write the following IP Addresses into a file 
named addresses.txt. (10.2.4.6, 10.10.160.23, 10.54.167.20). Each address 
should appear on a separate line. 
Create code that will allow you to create and read addresses.txt. 


def main():
    ip_addr = open(r'c:\Users\Katricej\Desktop\addresses.txt', 'w')
    num1 = (input('Enter the first IP address: '))
    num2 = (input('Enter the second IP address: '))
    num3 = (input('Enter the third IP address: '))             

    ip_addr.write(num1 + '\n')
    ip_addr.write(num2 + '\n')
    ip_addr.write(num3 + '\n')

    ip_addr.close()
    print("the ip addresses have beeb written to addresses.txt")

main()








 
2.You have been promoted to the senior pen-tester role at Cyborg Limited. 
You are currently tasked to create a wordlist called rockyou.txt that will be 
used to brute force an SSH account on a remote target server. The words 
are Pa$$w0rd, admin, abc123, and myaaaah!. Each word should appear on 
a separate line. 
Create code that will allow you to write and read rockyou.txt. 

def main():
    
    outfile = open(r'c:\Users\Katricej\Desktop\rockyou.txt', 'a')
    outfile.write('Pa$$w0rd\n')
    outfile.write('admin\n')
    outfile.write('abc123\n')
    outfile.write('myaaaa!')
    outfile.close
    
main()


                   
def read_file():
     outfile = open(r'c:\Users\Katricej\Desktop\rockyou.txt', 'r')
     contents = outfile.read()
     print(contents)
     outfile.close()

read_file()

                   
 
 
3.Write a python code that writes your device’s MAC address into a text file 
called macaddress.txt. 
Write code that will allow you to read macaddress.txt. 


def main():
    mac_addr = (input("What is your MAC address:  ?"))
    runfile = open('macaddress.txt', 'w')
    runfile.write(mac_addr)
    runfile.close()
    print('mac_addr has been written to file')


    openfile = open('macaddress.txt', 'r')
    print('first attempt')
    print(openfile.read())
    openfile.close()
    openfile = open("macaddress.txt",'r')
    print('second attempt')
    x= openfile.read()
    print(x)
    openfile.close()
