Wireless Concepts and Standards
Enterprise Wireless Network Design

Electromagnet Spectrum (EM)
Divided into different bands
Radio Waves- 30 Hz-300GHz Radio, Telephone, GPS
Microwave- 300 MHz-300GHz WiFi, cell phone, GPS, Lband, Kaband
Infrared- Used for remote control, night vision googles
Visible- Majore source is from the Sun
Ultraviolet- Radiation to sterilize equipement
X-rays- super short wavelength, used for medical purposes
Gamma- Kills cancer cells, hazardous to living organisms

Hertz- “Hz” - is one cycle/second



 Wave Characteristics
 -  Amplitude (the height of peaks and troughs)
 -  Frequency (the number of peaks per unit of time)
-   Phase (the angle of a wave at a point in time)

Modulation
Changes one or more of the above properties to encode a signal
How a wave becomes a “1” or “0” (MODULATION)


 Frequency Band
 Series of frequencies with a lower and upper limit
 Usually denoted to by the wavelength
 Common WLAN frequency bands: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz
 Frequency bands subdivided into small segments (“channels”)


Channels
Allow devices to simultaneously communicate within the same frequency band
Each Channel 20MgHz wide

FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
 Uses narrow frequency band and hops data signals in short data bursts transmitted in a predictable sequence from frequency to frequency
 Each burst goes to next frequency in the sequence
 Frequency Hopping occurs hundreds of times a second
 Avoids interference that may be on a single frequency
 Hopping between frequencies increases transmission security (more difficult to eavesdrop and capture data)
 Cheaper and performs better than DSSS
Developed by Hedy Lamarr

DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
 The transmitter breaks data stream into small pieces (“CHIPS”) and sends them across multiple frequencies in defined range
 Chips spread over all available frequencies at same time
 More efficient/higher throughput than FHSS but more susceptible to interference and less secure than FHSS
Benefits: More Bandwidth, Encoded Data, Low-power density and noise like signals

Pseudonoise Sequence (PN) 
Sequence of binary values (0s & 1s) that appears random but is actually generated by a known Algorithm


Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
 Breaks data into very small data streams to send the information across long distances where environmental obstacles may be an issue


802.11 Wireless Standards
 WLAN- defines how radio waves communicate over distances
 Works at OSI Layers 1 and 2
 Supports TCP/IP higher-layer OSI protocols and OS
 Most WLANs are based on IEEE 802.11 standards
 Commonly known as  “wireless fidelity” (Wi-Fi)

Common 802.11 standards
802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax




Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
                     AND
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

CSMA/CD 
Used in Wired Ethernet 
-Older half duplex
Not relevant today because switches are used to create a Full duplex

CSMA/CA
Used on Wireless networks (No cables involved)
Wireless devices have major issues
Not designed to simultaneously
Transmit and receive
Can NOT  prevent/detect collisions like wired devices
 Must use different access method to AVOID (rather than detect) collisions
 
CSMA/CA vs. CSMA/CD
 Wireless communication operates in half-duplex
EX: Shared two-way communication
Devices can both send and receive, but not at the same time
Devices take turns using transmission channel
Once device begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmitter to stop transmitting before it can reply

 RTS/CTS (Request to Send/Clear to Send) protocol
 Ensures packets not hindered by other transmissions (like hidden nodes)



Single User Multiple Input-Multiple Output (SU-MIMO)
APs/STAs with multiple antennas (802.11n & above) will transmit/receive concurrently 
Several antennas for transmitters and receivers (radio chain)
Device simultaneously processes data thru many antennas
Increase signal quality/range and network throughput


 Multi-User Multiple Inpit- Mulitple Output (MU-MIMO)
 Newer technology (802.11ac) allows multiple antennas to service multiple clients concurrently
 Allows multiple users to use the same channel
 Reduces congestion; contributes to faster data transmission
 Available with WAVE2 802.11ac products
Increases Performance
Versions: 2x2, 3x3, & 4x4 
Devices don't have to wait their turn (Works Concurrently)
Beamforming- strengthens signal, sends transmissions specifically aimed in a specific direction

Channel Bonding
Combine two non-overlapping 20 MHz channels into single 40 MHz channel
Doubling bandwidth available in single 20MHz channel
Works best in 5-GHz frequency band
Allowing for up to 160 MHz wide channels
