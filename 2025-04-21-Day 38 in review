Routing Technologies 
Dynamic Routing Technologies

Rounting Technologies define how packets are directed and forwarded across interconnected networks to reach their final destination

Static and Dynamic Routing
Static Routing is MANUALLY configured
used where network security is a concern
Adavantages: Simplicity, Realiability, Predictability, Security, and Performance

Dynamic Routing is AUTOMATICALLY learned
Routers automatically adapt to changes in the network
Advantages: More Flexible and resilient than Static
Disadvantages: More Complex to setup, Less Secure


Metrics
Metrics is a value that routers use to determine the BEST PATH to a destination.
Lower Metric= More Preferred Route / EX: 1s is better than 2 (the lower number is a better option/route)
Metric Values- Assigned by the routing protocol

Routers
Routers
Digital Direction Signs
Determine the BEST PATH for packets to travel
Uses Routing tables

Routing Tables
Routing Tables -A list of directions.  Contain information about HOW to reach different network destinations
INCLUDES:
Destination Network- Where the packet wants to go
Next Hop- Where to send the next packet
Interface- Which port to use to send it
Metric- How "good" or "bad" the path is
Administrative Distance (AD)- Trust level of the source

Administrative Distance
Administrative Distance (AD) - Distance used by router to determine which routing protocol has priority.  
A number that routers use to decide which routing source to TRUST when there are mulitple routes to the same destination.
The LOWER the AD the MORE TRUSTWORTHY the route

Subinterface
Subinterface- a logical division of a single physical network interface on a router or switch.
It allows that one physical interface to carry multiple VLANS of IP Networks, behaving as if it were multiple interfaces
SAME physical port, BUT treated like SEPERATE Connections

Routing Packets means figuring out where to send data so it gets to the right destination

Routing Metrics
Routing Metrics define the value or cost assigned to different paths in a network.
Routing Metrics Protocols
Hop Count- Number of Routers (used by RIP)
Bandwidth- Higher Bandwidth= Lower cost (used by OSPF, EIGRP)
Delay- Time for a packet to reach destination (used by EIGRP)
Cost- Admin-defined value, often based on bandwidth (used by OSPF)
Reliability- Link Stability (used by EIGRP)
MTU- Maximum Transmission Unit size
Load- Current traffic on the path

TERMS TO KNOW

Routing Information Protocol (RIP)- one of the oldest distance vector dynamic routing protocols, designed for small to medium-sized networks

Distance Vector Protocol- shares entire routing table with NEIGHBORS
Rumor
Hop
uses RIP
uses IGRP

RIPv1- Classful (NO support for CIDR or subnet masks)- OUTDATED doesn't understand subnets

RIPv2- Classless SUPPORTS subnetting and multicast updates

Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)- Finds the BEST PATH within a network by using a combination of metrics like bandwidth and delay
Cisco Proprietary Protocol
Hybrid Protocol
Features fast convergence, Low bandwidth, used in Enterprise Networks

Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)- Helps routers share information to route data
Three Types- Distance Vector, Link State, and Hybrid 

Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)- Manages how data is routed between large networks.
Ex: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)= Internet

Link State- routing protocol where routers share information about the state of their links (connections) with ALL other routers in the network.  
Actual information
Not Rumor
uses OSPF
usesv IS-IS

Hybrid-combination of Distance Vector and Link state
uses EIGRP
