Today was my first day of class at the City of Refuge Cybersecurity program. I was able to meet a diverse group of people with a common goal of being successful in the program. During our campus tour we learned about the many ways this organization helps and supports individuals in need. The highlight of my day was hearing from the program directors and instructors.  After each person spoke about the program, the expections of the students, and the overall goal of the program, I truly felt extremely motivated and encouraged to trust the process and do great in this program. I feel like we all have a strong support system within this organization.
