Day & Review – OSI Model, Practice Tests, and Continued Growth

Today I focused on strengthening my understanding of the OSI model by watching a Professor Messer video. He used a mnemonic I was already familiar with:
All People Seem To Need Data Processing — representing the seven layers from Application to Physical.

Here’s a quick summary of what I reviewed:
	•	Layer 1 – Physical: Deals with physical signals transmitted through cables or fiber. Troubleshooting at this layer might involve loopback tests (using IP address 127.0.0.1), replacing cables, or swapping out adapter cards.
	•	Layer 2 – Data Link (Switching Layer): Manages MAC addresses and DLC protocols. This is where devices communicate on a local network.
	•	Layer 3 – Network (Routing Layer): Involves IP addresses and routers. It handles fragmentation and routing between networks.
	•	Layer 4 – Transport (Post Office Layer): Focuses on TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable) communications.
	•	Layer 5 – Session: Manages and maintains connections between devices.
	•	Layer 6 – Presentation: Handles encryption and data formatting (SSL/TLS).
	•	Layer 7 – Application: The layer we interact with directly — examples include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, and POP3.

Professor Messer also related these layers to real-world examples using Wireshark, a free, open-source network protocol analyzer. He demonstrated how data is encapsulated and how each layer contributes—from seeing a website like https://mail.google.com at the application layer, to TCP and IP encapsulation in the transport and network layers, all the way down to electrical signals at the physical layer.

In addition to the video:
	•	I retook a networking practice test on Udemy. Yesterday I scored an 84%, and today I improved to a 90% — I’m definitely becoming more confident with the material.
	•	I also retook a quiz on different cable types. My first score was 68.75% (22/32), and after reviewing, I brought it up to 81.25% (26/32). I was hesitant to retake it because I wasn’t sure which answers were right or wrong. While the score improvement is great, I wish I could see the questions I missed so I can focus on them going forward.

My plan tomorrow is to go back and review the modules I haven’t fully absorbed yet and take more detailed notes. I’m proud of the progress I’m making and looking forward to building more confidence in these core networking concepts.
