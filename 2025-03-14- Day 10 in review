Today, we dove deeper into Linux commands and their usage, staying focused on the corresponding slides. It feels like we made great progress, covering a lot of material. Although we’re still slightly behind, I’m hopeful we’ll catch up next week.
This weekend, I plan to study more and revisit some of the slides I’ve marked for review. There are a few areas I had questions about, and I want to make sure I spend extra time on them to fully grasp the concepts.
Looking forward to keeping up the momentum!
