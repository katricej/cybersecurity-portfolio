Today, we had an out-of-school study session organized by the students. At the start, we worked on structuring our session to make it as productive as possible. I suggested reaching out to our instructor for a study guide in advance so we could prepare before class, allowing for a more meaningful discussion and participation.
For this session, we mainly reviewed material from last week and helped each other with topics that needed more reinforcement. One of the highlights for me was assisting my classmates with Binary Code. I had simplified it in a way that made sense to me, and by explaining it that way, I was able to help others grasp the concept more easily. It felt great to contribute and support my fellow classmates in their learning.
Overall, it was a productive and collaborative session, and I look forward to implementing even better strategies in future study groups!
