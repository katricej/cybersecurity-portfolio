# About Me
**Name:** Katrice Johnson
**Hometown:** Atlanta, Georgia/ United States
**Prior IT Experience:** I graduated from Atlanta Technical College Cybersecurity Associates Degree Program.  I am interested in learning more about this field and getting more hands-on experience.
**Career Plans:** After graduating from this Cybersecurity course, I would like to earn industry certifications to strengthen my technical foundation.  I plan to start my career in Cybersecurity Analysis, gaining hands on experience in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability assessments.  My long term goal is to transition into leadership and management roles.  Once I have gained significant experience in the field, I want to give back by mentoring and guiding aspiring cybersecurity professionals, helping them navigate their career paths.  Ultimately, my goal is to work for a top cybersecurity company contributing to the protection of organizations from evolving threats. 
**Proud Project/Task:** While I am still developing my technical cybersecurity skills, my previous experience as a Backoffice Team Lead has given me strong problem-solving and leadership skills.  In my role, I had to think critically, make quick decisions, and ensure accuracy under pressure. I'm dedicated to applying this mindset to learning more about Cybersecurity throughout this course.
