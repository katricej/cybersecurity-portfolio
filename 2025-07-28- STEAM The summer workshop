STEAM THE SUMMER (Stem workshop for Children/Teens)

Had a great time volunteering at STEAM The Summer — a hands-on workshop designed to spark curiosity and creativity in kids through science, tech, engineering, art, and math!

I was happy to support with setup and registration alongside the incredible team at NPursuit and our amazing partners. From tech demos and gaming stations to interactive experiments, this event brought STEAM to life in the most exciting way.

It’s so inspiring to see events like this that make technology and learning fun for all ages. Looking forward to seeing how this movement continues to grow!
