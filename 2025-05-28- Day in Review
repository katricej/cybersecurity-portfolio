Today, we had the incredible honor of meeting and listening to Mr. Richard Cox, a proud Atlanta native and an inspiring leader at Delta Air Lines. His journey from humble beginnings on the south side of Atlanta to a top operational role at one of the world’s most recognized airlines was nothing short of motivational.

From an early age, Mr. Cox has always been driven, consistently putting in the work to excel — even when the odds weren’t in his favor. One of the most powerful messages he shared was a mantra he recites with his young son: “Work hard, have faith, help others.” It’s not just something he says — it’s a principle he lives by.

He spoke about the influential people in his life, like his tough football coach, Coach Rambo, who saw greatness in him and pushed him to reach it. Even when he wasn’t the most naturally gifted athlete, his relentless work ethic helped him outwork everyone else — a mindset that has served him well beyond the football field.

Mr. Cox’s story is a testament to how problem-solving, consistency, and relationship-building can transform your career. He started as a temp in a warehouse, and through hard work and a desire to tackle challenges, he rose to one of the highest levels in operations at Delta.

Key takeaways from Mr. Cox:
	•	Think bigger: Your goals should stretch your vision. Set them, write them down, and grade yourself regularly.
	•	Grow where you’re planted: You may not start where you want, but progress begins right where you are.
	•	Failure is part of success: You won’t always get a “yes,” but every “no” is a lesson that moves you forward.
	•	Build positive habits: Your daily routines shape your long-term growth.
	•	Surround yourself wisely: Choose people and environments that push you toward effectiveness and growth.

What truly stood out was his genuine energy and positivity — it was infectious. Every story he told carried a life lesson, and his words were both real and relatable. Hearing how he built his career with integrity, faith, and hard work made many of us reflect on how we can raise our own standards.

Personally, I walked away both inspired and challenged. As someone who considers themselves a hard worker, I realize there’s still another level I can reach — and Mr. Cox gave a clear example of what that looks like.

We are incredibly grateful for his time and his willingness to pour so much wisdom into us. He is definitely someone to model after.
