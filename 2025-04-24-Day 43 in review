FIREWALLS

Firewalls- allows or denies traffic
Filter

TYPES OF FIREWALLS

Packet Filtering Firewall
Most Basic of Firewalls
Inspects individual packets based on Rules
Stateless
Examines address information in packet header
Operates at Layers 3 Nework and Layer 4 Transport of the OSI Model
Used in routers and basic firewalls

Circut Level Gateway
A type of firewall that operates at the Session layer 5 of the OSI Model
Manages TCP and UDP
Does not Filter packets
Keeps Connections private

Application Level Gateway
Also known as a Proxy Firewall
Inspects and filters data within applications like HTTP, FTP, and DNS
Acts as a Proxy- "Middle Man" between user and destination
Hides Internal Network details
Can Block specific actions, like file downloads or commands
Works at the Application Layer 7 of the OSI Model

RULES USED
MAC addresses
IP Protocols
Ports
Domain Name
Applications/Content
Keywords
Conversation/stream

STATEFUL VS STATELESS

STATEFUL 
Makes decisions based on a Whole picture
Monitors the state of active connections and REMEMBERS the context of traffic
Track Sessions
Remembers Connections
Context Aware
Dynamic Rules
Smart Filtering
Remembers the State
Long Memory
Ex: It's like a security guard who remembers everyone who is in the building
The most important feature of Dynamic/STATEFUL is packets are examined as a stream. 
Packets are examined as a WHOLE, not as a simple sum of parts
Analyzes the Incoming packet for its Authenticity in order to ensure that the packet is NOT altered during the transmission.

STATELESS
Static- makes decisions based on variables (IP address, MAC address, Port numbers)
Treats each packet as an independent
NO Memory
Rule Based
Fast but Basic
Context-Blind
Treats each packet like it's brand new
Ex:  It's like a guard who checks each visitor seperately, and does not remember who came in before
Short Memory

UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT (UTM)
UTM- All in one security device that combines multiple security features and services into a single appliance 
Or act as a Firewall, Switch, Load Balancer, or DHCP server
