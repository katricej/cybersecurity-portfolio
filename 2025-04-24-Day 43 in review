FIREWALLS

Firewalls- allows or denies traffic
Filter

TYPES OF FIREWALLS

Packet Filtering Firewall
Most Basic of Firewalls
Inspects individual packets based on Rules
Stateless
Examines address information in packet header
Operates at Layers 3 Nework and Layer 4 Transport of the OSI Model
Used in routers and basic firewalls

Circut Level Gateway
A type of firewall that operates at the Session layer 5 of the OSI Model
Manages TCP and UDP
Does not Filter packets
Keeps Connections private

Application Level Gateway
Also known as a Proxy Firewall
Inspects and filters data within applications like HTTP, FTP, and DNS
Acts as a Proxy- "Middle Man" between user and destination
Hides Internal Network details
Can Block specific actions, like file downloads or commands
Works at the Application Layer 7 of the OSI Model

RULES USED
MAC addresses
IP Protocols
Ports
Domain Name
Applications/Content
Keywords
Conversation/stream

STATEFUL VS STATELESS

STATEFUL 
Makes decisions based on a Whole picture
Monitors the state of active connections and REMEMBERS the context of traffic
Track Sessions
Remembers Connections
Context Aware
Dynamic Rules
Smart Filtering
Remembers the State
Long Memory
Ex: It's like a security guard who remembers everyone who is in the building
The most important feature of Dynamic/STATEFUL is packets are examined as a stream. 
Packets are examined as a WHOLE, not as a simple sum of parts
Analyzes the Incoming packet for its Authenticity in order to ensure that the packet is NOT altered during the transmission.

STATELESS
Static- makes decisions based on variables (IP address, MAC address, Port numbers)
Treats each packet as an independent
NO Memory
Rule Based
Fast but Basic
Context-Blind
Treats each packet like it's brand new
Ex:  It's like a guard who checks each visitor seperately, and does not remember who came in before
Short Memory

UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT (UTM)
UTM- All in one security device that combines multiple security features and services into a single appliance 
Or act as a Firewall, Switch, Load Balancer, or DHCP server

NEXT GENERATION FIREWALL (NGFW)
Advanced security tool designed to protect businesses from Cyber threats
Analyze content
Deep Packet Inspection
Application Awareness 
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
User Identification

APPLICATION FIREWALL
Decides whether to drop or send packet based on the applicaiton data available in the packet.
Blocks URLs, Specific words, Images, Videos

HARDWARE BASED FIREWALLS
Physical Device (EX: Server)
Protects the entire Network /A network segment
Most are "Network Based" (though they use Hardware and Software)

SOFTWARE BASED FIREWALLS
Code runs inside device via an app and inspects traffic received by a host. 
Almost all Host-based firewalls are Software firewalls
EX: MS Defender, Symantec, McAfee

APPLIANCE FIREWALLS
Stand alone Hardware firewall
Performs ONLY the function of a Firewall 
EX: Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)

ROUTER FIREWALL
Firewall functionsat the Layer 3 & 4 (Switch and Access Point)
Firewall functionality is built into the router firmware ( SOHO, Enterprise-class router)

PROXY SERVER
Acts as an agent on behalf of its client
A caching machine
Controlling inbound and outbound traffic
Can keep track of all traffic outbound and inbound
Can be setup to bypass firewalls
Also Known As: "Bypassing Firewall" or "Climbing Over the Great Wall"
A proxy is someone or something that has authority to do something for another person or thing

FORWARD PROXY
Protects the Client
Client going OUT to the Server
Private Network > Internet > Forward Proxy > Server
Benefits:
Logs User activity
Can bypass restricted content
Speed - Caching (Storing) copies of Websites in its Database

REVERSE PROXY
Protects Servers
Outside Traffic Coming IN to the server
Outside Traffic > Internet > Reverse Proxy > Server
Single point of entry that can regulate traffic
Benefits:
Increases security on private networks(HIDE Addresses)
Block Malicious traffic such as DDoS attacks
Load Balancing- evenly distribute traffic

TYPES OF NETWORKS

LAN- Local area Network
Group of devices/computers located on the same network.  Most common Ethernet

WLAN- Wireless Area Network
Uses wireless communication
Has wifi router or wireless access point
LAN without cables

CAN- Campus Area Network
Joins two or more LANs together within a limited area

MAN- Metropolitan Area Network
Larger the a CAN
Spans over several buildings in city/town
Uses Fiber Optic
EX: Police station, City Hall, Fire Dept

SAN- Storage Area Network
Stores and provides access to large amounts of Data
Not affected by Network Traffic

WAN- Wide Area Network
Largest type
EX: The Internet

Network Topology
Star- Most common, All computers have own cable connections
Ring- Old, Data packet sent around ring until it gets to its destination
Bus- Very Old- connected to a single coax cable (T connector)
MESH- computer connected to every other computer.  Expensive, used in WAN (internet)

THREE-TIERD NETWORK HIERACHY
Scalable- the ability to provide growth
Resilient- Tolerate faulty devices and keep working
Manageable- How easy is it to monitor changes, troubleshoot, etc

Cisco Design
Model used to struture large enterprise networks. It breaks down into three layers:
1)    Core- Transport Large amounts of data across the network
2)    Distribution- Policy control, Routing, and Access control. Enforces rules, aggregates access layer traffic
3)    Access- Provides Network access to end devices (PCs, printers, IP phones)
