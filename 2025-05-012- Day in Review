Wireless Concepts and Standards
Enterprise Wireless Network Design

Electromagnet Spectrum (EM)
Divided into different bands
Radio Waves- 30 Hz-300GHz Radio, Telephone, GPS
Microwave- 300 MHz-300GHz WiFi, cell phone, GPS, Lband, Kaband
Infrared- Used for remote control, night vision googles
Visible- Majore source is from the Sun
Ultraviolet- Radiation to sterilize equipement
X-rays- super short wavelength, used for medical purposes
Gamma- Kills cancer cells, hazardous to living organisms

Hertz- “Hz” - is one cycle/second



 Wave Characteristics
 -  Amplitude (the height of peaks and troughs)
 -  Frequency (the number of peaks per unit of time)
-   Phase (the angle of a wave at a point in time)

Modulation
Changes one or more of the above properties to encode a signal
How a wave becomes a “1” or “0” (MODULATION)


 Frequency Band
 Series of frequencies with a lower and upper limit
 Usually denoted to by the wavelength
 Common WLAN frequency bands: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz
 Frequency bands subdivided into small segments (“channels”)


Channels
Allow devices to simultaneously communicate within the same frequency band
Each Channel 20MgHz wide

FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
 Uses narrow frequency band and hops data signals in short data bursts transmitted in a predictable sequence from frequency to frequency
 Each burst goes to next frequency in the sequence
 Frequency Hopping occurs hundreds of times a second
 Avoids interference that may be on a single frequency
 Hopping between frequencies increases transmission security (more difficult to eavesdrop and capture data)
 Cheaper and performs better than DSSS
Developed by Hedy Lamarr

DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
 The transmitter breaks data stream into small pieces (“CHIPS”) and sends them across multiple frequencies in defined range
 Chips spread over all available frequencies at same time
 More efficient/higher throughput than FHSS but more susceptible to interference and less secure than FHSS
Benefits: More Bandwidth, Encoded Data, Low-power density and noise like signals

Pseudonoise Sequence (PN) 
Sequence of binary values (0s & 1s) that appears random but is actually generated by a known Algorithm


Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
 Breaks data into very small data streams to send the information across long distances where environmental obstacles may be an issue


802.11 Wireless Standards
 WLAN- defines how radio waves communicate over distances
 Works at OSI Layers 1 and 2
 Supports TCP/IP higher-layer OSI protocols and OS
 Most WLANs are based on IEEE 802.11 standards
 Commonly known as  “wireless fidelity” (Wi-Fi)

Common 802.11 standards
802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax
