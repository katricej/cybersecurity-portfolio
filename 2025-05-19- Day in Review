Virtualization
Datacenter and Storage Networks
Cloud Concepts


Virtualization
Logical (Virtual) version of something Real (Physical)
Creates virtual versions of computer resources
Advantages:
Diverse OS
Isolation 
Legacy Apps

Virtual Machine (VM)
ALso known as "Guest"
Software emulates a computer that runs in an isolated part of the physical computer
Disadvantages:
Consume a lot of disk space
Slow to startup
Consume a lot RAM and CPU Power
Requires a license for each OS

Host- Physical computer running "Hosting" the virtual machine

Hypervisor
Creates and manages VMs 
All VMs on a single host share the same CPU, hard disks, memory NIC


Type 1 Hypervisor
"Bare Metal"
Functions like an OS
XenServer (Citrix), ESX: (VMware), Hyper-V (Microsoft)

Type 2 Hypervisor
"Hoste"
Not as powerful, Not as secure, and Not as fast as Type 1 Hypervisor
Dependent on Host OS
For testing purposes/Learning
Client Hyper-V, Virtual Box, VMware Player, Linux KVM




Virtual Servers and Virtual Networks

Virtual Servers
Multiple Server OS instances run on single Physical host
EX:  DHCP, file, Web Services

Virtual Networks
Allow virtual servers/desktops to communication
Host allows the virtual network to communicate with network devices out on the Physical Network

Virtual Switch
Allow multiple virtual servers and/or desktops to communicate on virtual network segments and/or the Physical network
Logical decvice works at the DataLink Layer (vSwitch)


Container
Virtualization software run apps and dependencies is an isolated cell
An application that's been packaged with all the files, configurtaions, dependencies neccessary for it to run
Virtual version of apps.  They're Fast!!
Containers only contain applications (No VM)
Advantages:
Microservices
Rapid Development and Deployment (Speed)
Resource Efficiency

Container Engine
Unpacks the container files and hands them off to the OS Kernel
The leading software that is used to Create, Manage, and Run containers is Docker
Docker- Opensource software, Container virtualized operating system

DataCenters
Dedicated location for hosting server infrastructure
Key Components:
Routers, Switches, Firewalls, Storage Systems, Servers

Traffic Flow
North-South Traffic- Traffic going TO and FROM Datacenter
East-West Traffic- Traffic going BETWEEN servers in Datacenter

Spine and Leaf Topology
Two-Layer Network Topology 
Spine Layer backbone of Top-Tier distribution switches
Leaf Layer- All access switches connect to every spine


Storage Area Networks

Direct Attached Storage (DAS)
Storage directly attached to Host
Low Cost, Low Maintanence
Suitable for Small Businesses that share data locally with little IT support

Network Attached Storage (NAS)
Storage Connected to production
Allows local and network access  
Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)
A data storage technology which uses striping, mirroring or parity to store data
Combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit
TYPES: 0,1,5.10
Raid 0- No Fault Tolerance, If fail occurs 
Raid 1- Is Fault Tolerance. Each disk has the same data. Data is copied on more than 1 disk
Raid 5- Requires 3 or more disks. Data is striped across multiple disks along with PARITY- used to rebuild data
Raid 10- ( 1+0 combined)- Use minimum of 4 disks. Can only use 50% of data storage


Fibre Channel (FC)
High speed network technology mainly used to connect data storage systems
Transfer Sensitive Data
Designed Specifically to support SAN
FC switches do not require IP Address
Transmit all frames in order

Interact Small Computer System Interface (ISCSI)
SCSI data is transmitted over IP-based network
Alternative to Fibre Channel
Does not require FC specific switches and adapters

Cloud Basics
Cloud- Synonym for the Internet
Cloud computing is software, Data Access, computation and storage services provided to clients through the Internet

Scalabilty- Ablilty to increase workload size by adding resources

Elasticity- is Automatically adjust and allocate computing resources on demand
Automatic scaling
Cost effectiveness (Pay what you use)
Real Time Responsiveness

Public Cloud
Multi-Tenant Cloud service offered over the Internet
