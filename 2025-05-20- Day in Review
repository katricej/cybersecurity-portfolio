Cloud Service Models
Cloud Categories 

Traditional 
All Hardware, Software and everything else is located and managed at the organizations location
No need for Internet services

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Hardware and network infrastructure devices are provided virtually 
Customer responsible for managing apps, data, runtime, middleware, and OS
User gets: Raw computing resources
You Manage: Your app platform and everything in between 
EX:  AWS EC2m Microsoft Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine


Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Delivers everything a developer/programmer needs to build an application on the cloud infrastructure
User gets: A platform to build and run their own apps
You manage- Your App and Data ONLY
EX:   Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Software as a Service (SaaS)
Delivers software applications to the client either over the Internet or on a local area network
EX: Office 365, Gmail, Google Docs, Zoom

Cloud Connectivity Options
Internet- use the CSP website or application program interface
Virtual Private Network (VPN)- use VPN for better security and congestion control
Direct/Private connection/ co location (Co-Lo) with datacenter
Large datacenter rents out rack space to 3rd parties
Direct link between organizations servers and cloud servers


Cloud Computing
Refers to data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than on your local computer 
Cost Reliability, Scalibility (Pay as you go), Elasticity, On Demand, Multi-Tenancy

Cloud Providers
AWS Amazon Web Services #1 Cloud provider, Biggest vendor Netflix
Microsoft Azure
Alibaba
IBM

Types:
Iaas, Paas, Saas


Resources:
Computing
Storage
Network
Software


Issues/Risks
3rd Party Control
Vendor Lock-In
Data Security/Privacy
Malicious Attacks

Deployment Models:
Public
Private
Hybrid
Community

Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Makes websites load faster by bringing the website content closer to the user
Reduces the cost of network Bandwidth 
Content Availability and Redundancy

Cloud Responsibility
Security OF the cloud - CSP responsible
Security IN the cloud - Client


Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
Software implenmentations decouple the network function from proprietary hardware
Used to Configure
Seperating software from Hardware
Instead of using Physical devices (like routers, firewalls, or load balancers).  You run them as Software on regular computers

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Multi-Tenant model provides isolated environment within a public cloud
"Datacenter" in the cloud
Combines Public and Private cloud
Amazon= VPC
Azure= Vnet

Public Subnet
Requires attaching an Internet gateway and configuring it as the default route 
Instances will be assigned public IP address

Private Subnet
Generally Back-end servers
Remains private without a default Internet Gateway

Internet Gateway
Route instance traffic with other subnets within the same VPC, subnets in another VPC, or the Internet

NAT-Gateway
Allows instances to connect out to Internet but not connections initiated from Internet

Cloud Gateway
Both Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway use NAT 
Internet Gateway is a two-way gateway and VMs are associated with public IP
NAT gateway is One gateway (Out bound) without VMs requiring public IP

Cloud Firewall
Barrier between cloud resources external threats
Characteristics:
Layer 3 (Network)- Accept/Deny traffic based on IP addresses and TCP/UDP port filtering
Layer 4 (Transport) - Stateful inspection of connections using rules to allow established/ related traffic
Layer 7 (Application) - Parsing Protocol headers/payloads for content-based filtering

Software Defined Networking (SDN)
Software Based Controllers of API to communicate
Uses dedicated hardware devices (EX: routers, switches) to control network traffic
Central Brain (Software) tells all devices what to do 
SDN means controlling a network using software instead of hardware
