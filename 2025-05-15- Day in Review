   Authentication 
Process of comparing & matching user’s credentials with the credentials in a database

Authentication for WIFI -Prove an identification
Shared (Pre-shared) key - Pass Phrase
    OR 
Enterprise:
RADIUS  UDP 1812 & 1813
TACACS+  port 49
LDAP  port 389
Kerberos port 88

 Hashing (INTEGRITY)
  Confirms data has NOT been changed (integrity)
  No denying you sent/sighed message (nonrepudiation)
  Irreversible – “there is no-de-hashing”
  This means – “one-way process only”

Hashing Algorithms
 MD5–message digest 5 (128-bit)
 SHA – Secure Hash Algorithm
 SHA1-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512

Digital Signature
Electronic, Encrypted, Stamp of AUTHENTICATION
Signature confirms that data originated from the signer and has not been altered
To send a digital sign document, you also send a digital certificate and public key (get from Certificate Authority CA)
Purpose:
1)  Authentication
2)  NonRepudiation- sender can't deny sending the message later on
3)  Integrity- Message not altered

Symmetric Key Encryption”; “SECRET KEY”
Single key used for both encryption and decryption
Sender and receiver have identical copy of key

How do you share the “secret key”???????
 Physical- telephone call, letter, post-it note, USB drive
 Public/Private key exchange
 1. Alice signs pwd (plaintext) with Alice’s private key - (hash)
 2. Alice encrypts [pwd+hash] with Bob’s public key - cipher
 3. Bob decrypts cipher using Bob’s private key - [pwd+hash]
 4. Bob uses Alice’s public key to create hash and compares this result with the hash that came from the cipher 


Public Key encryption for Confidentiality and Authentication
Public key encryption for confidentiality:
 -Sender encrypts with receiver’s public key
 -Receiver decrypts with receiver’s private key

Public key encryption for authentication:
-Sender encrypts message with sender’s private key
-Receiver decrypts message with the true party’s public key

Preshared-key  PSK
EX: Password that is shared with the client and the Access Point (AP)



Wi-Fi Encryption Standards

WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3 are ALL private key ciphers

 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
 Uses cipher not suitable for secure wireless
 NEVER USE!!!!!!
Easily Hackable
RC4
40 Bit Key length


 Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
 Intended as intermediate measure to replace WEP while 802.11i fully developed
 Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption
RC4
128 Bit Key length
Don't Use!!!!!
 
 Authentication Support - both:
 Pre-shared key (WPA-PSK or WPA Personal)
 802.1x (WPA Enterprise) authentication
 Can use pre-shared keys or dynamic keys

 Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)
 Wireless security adheres to 802.11i specifications
 Built on theory of Robust Secure Networks (RSN)
 Intended to replace WEP and WPA
• Characteristics
 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption
 Similar to TKIP but requires special hardware
 Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP)
 Also known As -  AES-CCMP
 4-way handshake
1328 bit key length

Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)
Introduced in 2018 to address the limitations of WPA2
Provides cutting edge security protocols to the market
Adds new features to simplify WiFi security
 Characteristics:
 Protected Management Frame (PMF)
 All “Management” frames (EX: Beacon, Probes) encrypted
 AES-CCMP and newer GCMP-256
 Individualized data encryption for each device
 Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
 Improved key exchange method
 Change handshaking method; block brute-force/MiTM
 Perfect Forward Secrecy
 Can’t decrypt prior captured data when attacker learns password - ONLY Newly captured data can be decrypted

 Captive Portal
 Act as a secondary authentication step in Open 
 Authentication or guest Wi-Fi networks
 Requires users to authenticate through a web page
 “Splash Page” for login- Web page that appears before main content
 Use HTTPS with TLS
 Digital certificate issued by Certificate Authority
 It's like a checkpoint before the Internet gate opens

Rogue Access Points
 Definition
 Evil twin: Fraudulent Wi-Fi AP mimicking a legitimate network
 Users unknowingly connect, allowing attackers to intercept data

Deauthentication Attacks
 Definition
 Disrupt connections between users and Wi-Fi access points
 Attackers force devices to lose access and then reconnect to a network they control

 Purpose:  
 Disrupt communication
 Detection and Prevention
 Attackers track connections, capture data, trick users into installing rogue programs

Roaming
The connection is not disconnected when moving from one coverage area to another

Flapping Clients:
Devices constantly switching between APs, causing unnecessary load and potential network disruptions

Roaming Standards:
Lack of support for 802.11k, 802.11r, and 802.11v standards


 Disassociation
 Used to notify other party that connection is ended

 Send forged frames to AP or client device causing disconnection
 “Deauthentication Attack”
 Spoof target’s MAC address then make AP disconnect target
 Management frames are transmitted w/o encryption
 Target assumes frames legit and disconnects; prevents reconnect
 Can also be done to all connected STAs

WAN and LAN

WAN
Owned and operated by Telcos (telecommunications carriers)
Also Known As NSPs (Network Service Providers)
EX: AT&T, Verizon, Charter, and Comcast
Data communication over large distances, often using public networks

LAN
Mostly owned\operated by the organization
Wiring is privately owned
Cover shorter, localized areas

Enterprise WAN
Network for a single organization spanning large geographic areas
Uses public telecom infrastructure for wide reaching connectivity


 WAN site
 A specific geographic location or endpoint connected by WAN

 WAN Link
Connection between one WAN site (endpoint) and another site
 Link type:
 Point to Point -One site to only one site 
 Multipoint -One site to two or more other sites

Virtual Circuit (VC)
WAN connection logically appears to be dedicated but, physically may have any configuration thru the Telco’s cloud

Demarcation Point (“Demarc”)
Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) installs a physical cable and a termination jack onto premises
Demarc: marks the boundary between the telco equipment and the organization's network or telephone system
Characteristics:
Generally, LEC responsible for all equipment on one side of the demarc
Customer is responsible for all equipment on the other side of the demarc
Demarc also called Minimum Point of Entry (MPOE) or End User Point of Termination (EU-POT).
The demarc is typically located on the bottom floor of a building, just inside the building for residential service, the demarc often a small box on the outside of the house



T-Carrier and Leased Line Provider Links
 T-1 Carrier System
 T-1 is dedicated logical digital standard developed by Bell Labs
 Created to allow multiple calls on a single cable  
 Dedicated Leased Line
 1.544 mbps

 Types of T-carrier lines
 T1
 Connects branch offices, connects to carrier
 T-carrier standards (T-CXR standards) uses TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) over two wire pairs to divide a single channel into multiple channels
 Multiplexing enables single T1 to carry 24 channels

 T3
 Provides 28 times more throughput than a T1
 More expensive than T1s
 Used by more data-intensive businesses 

Fractional T1
Allows organizations to use only some of the channels on a T1 line
Charged according to the number of channels they use

Cable
Cable TV connection creates a wide area connection to Internet
Cable modem (router) connects computer device to cable network for sending networking signals
Same cable line carries networking and cable TV signals
In some cases a separate line is installed for internet access



Fiber to the Curb
 Fiber to the X (FTTx)
 Generic term for any broadband network design using optical fiber in all or part of the local loop’s  last mile
 Fiber optic link used in some or all of local loop’s “last mile” 
 Examples:
 Fiber to the Network – “FTTN”: Fiber terminated in Street cabinet that could be a few miles away
 Fiber to the Curb – (FTTC): Fiber terminates within 300 yards of customer premises
 Fiber to the Premise – (FTTP): Blanket term of FTTH & FTTB
 Fiber to the Building– (FTTB) Fiber terminates at building; typically a multi-unit
 Fiber to the Home– (FTTH)- Fiber terminates at home/org


Metro-optical Provider Links
