Today was the day!
I took my CompTIA Network+ exam… and I passed!

I woke up this morning feeling a whirlwind of emotions — nervous, anxious, excited, and even a little scared all at once.

I arrived at the testing site super early to calm my nerves and go over my notes one last time. But eventually, I told myself:
“You know what? I’m ready. Let’s do this.”

I walked into the testing center feeling amped up and determined. And once I started the exam, my nerves began to fade because I realized:
“Wait a minute… I actually know this.”

A huge shoutout to my instructor, Mr. Darryl, who worked so hard to prepare me and my classmates for this moment. I put in the study time, I stayed focused, and I went in believing in myself.

Then came the moment I’ll never forget:
“Congratulations — you passed.”

That message popped up on the screen, and I felt an overwhelming sense of relief, joy, and accomplishment. It was such an emotional moment — I honestly couldn’t wait to call almost everyone I knew to share the news.

This was a major milestone for me. I’m incredibly thankful for my instructor, my classmates, and my family for supporting me through this journey. I’m proud, I’m relieved, and I’m ready for what’s next.
