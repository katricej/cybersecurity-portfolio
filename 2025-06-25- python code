Chapter 7 Labs: LISTS AND TUPLES 
1.Using python, create a list of 4 fruits and store them in the variable fruits 
and display each on the same line. Create another list of your top 3 
musicians, store them in a variable called music and display each on a 
separate line using the FOR loop. Use the same music list to display the 
musicians on separate lines using Indexing and WHILE loop. 


num_days = int(input('Enter days to collect sales data:  '))

def main():
    sales = [0] * num_days
    index = 0
    print('Enter the sales for each day.')
    while index < num_days:
        print('Sales for day #', index +1)
        sales[index] = float(input())
        index = index + 1
        print()
        print('Here are the values you entered:')
        for values in sales:
            print(values)


main()


 
2.Write a python program that will count the number of items in the list 
called fruits in problem 1. HINT: use a built-in function 
 
 
fruits = ['Pineapples', 'Watermelon', 'Blueberries', 'Mango']
juicy_fruit = len(fruits)
print(f"The number of fruit in this list is: ", juicy_fruit)






3.Create a python program that displays the fruit list in question 1, then 
prompts the user to add additional pieces of fruit to the already created list. 
Display the new fruit list’s contents on separate lines. 

def manage_fruit_list():


fruits = ['apples', 'banana', 'cherry' ]
print("initial fruit list", fruits)

while true:
    new_fruit =input("enter a fruit to add (or type 'done' to finish) : ")
    if new_fruit.lower() == 'done':
        break
    fruits.append(new_fruit)

    print("\nUpdated fruit list:")
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)

if _name_ =="_main_")
    manage_fruit_list()



 
 
4.Using a python program join the list (in question 1) called fruits with the list 
called music and display the content of the new list using a FOR loop. 
 

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
music = ["jazz", "rock", "pop"]

# Join the two lists
combined_list = fruits + music

# Display each item using a for loop
for groups in combined_list:
    print(f"{groups}")


print(f'\nTotal items: (len(combined_list)) '0)


 
5.Using question 4 code, determine whether the pungent fruit durian and the 
musician Prince are contained in the list. 
 fruits =['Pineapples', 'Lemon', 'Strawberry', 'Mango']
music = ['Currency', 'Larry June', 'Thundercat']


combined_list = fruits + music

print('Combined list contents: ')
for groups in combined_list:
    print(f'(groups)')

print(f"\nTotal items: len(combined_list)")

if search in combined_list:
    print(search, "is in the list")
else:
    print(search, "Not in here!!")






Chapter 7 HW: LISTS AND TUPLES 
1.Design a program that asks the user to enter a store’s sales for each day of 
the week. The amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate 
the total sales for the week and display the result. HINT: store is open 24/7 
 
 

num_days = int(input("Enter days to collect sales data:  '))

def main():
    sales = [0] * num_days
    index = 0
    print('Enter the sales for each day.')
    while index < num_days:
        print('Sales for day #', index +1)
        sales[index] = float(input())
        index = index + 1
        print()
        print('Here are the values you entered:')
        for values in sales:
            print(values)


main()
