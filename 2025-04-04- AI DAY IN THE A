AI in a Day – City of Refuge

Today, I had the opportunity to participate in AI in a Day at City of Refuge — a powerful, eye-opening event filled with informative classes and thought-provoking discussions centered around artificial intelligence.

We were divided into three separate discussion groups, and my group focused specifically on the ethical concerns surrounding AI. The session started with a brief overview by our moderator, followed by everyone introducing themselves and sharing one word that comes to mind when thinking about AI. Mine was actually two — “helpful and convenient” — which truly reflects how I see AI being used today.

One of the most compelling parts of our discussion centered around fairness and access to AI tools and knowledge. A fellow attendee, an African-American man, made an important observation: there’s very little awareness about tools like ChatGPT in some communities — no commercials, no radio conversations, very limited visibility. I added to that by sharing an experience from our cybersecurity class, where a classmate had never even heard of ChatGPT until we, her peers, introduced her to it. That really hit home — how many people are being unintentionally left behind in this technological wave?

We also participated in a role-based activity, where each group represented a different community perspective — students, business owners, and community activists. I was in the business owner group, and our questions focused on practical concerns:
	•	What are the costs of implementing AI?
	•	What kind of security can we expect for our business and employees?
	•	What rights do we really have as users and owners of AI systems?
	•	And, importantly, who really owns the data and output—us or the AI platform?
We also raised concerns about regulation — how much of it is out there, and how much is needed?

The student group had a good discussion about how AI helps them in their academic journey, which sparked a moment of reflection for me. I remember being in college and having to do everything manually — now AI makes things a lot more accessible and efficient for students. It’s a huge shift in how learning happens.

The community activist group had deep concerns about facial recognition and how inaccuracies can lead to racial profiling, especially in minority communities. These conversations were powerful and necessary.

One personal highlight for me was connecting with a young entrepreneur in my group. She became really interested in the programs offered by City of Refuge, and I was able to share details about upcoming info sessions. Her excitement reminded me why community engagement and information sharing are so important.

The day ended on a high note — full of new perspectives, great connections, and a deeper understanding of the many layers of AI. I walked away learning things I never considered before, and I’m grateful to have been a part of such an impactful experience.
