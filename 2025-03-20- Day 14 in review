Today was a mix of challenges and inspiration. The morning was spent covering Package Management, and I’ll admit—some of the concepts, especially understanding the backend and frontend aspects, were a bit confusing. But learning is a process, and I’m embracing every part of it!
The second half of my day, however, was truly energizing. I had the pleasure of attending a CISO roundtable event hosted by Ed Pascua with the Cloud Security Risk Alliance. It was an honor to be surrounded by such brilliant and knowledgeable cybersecurity professionals.
A highlight of the event was meeting former City of Refuge students who shared their incredible success stories—each one a testament to resilience, growth, and opportunity in this field. Their journeys were truly inspiring.
What stood out to me the most was how open and willing the CISOs and other guests were to engage in conversation. Their insights and encouragement reaffirmed my passion for cybersecurity. One day, I hope to attain the same level of expertise so I can support and guide others just as they did for me today.

Beyond the inspiration, today was about building connections and exploring potential career opportunities. I’m excited for what’s ahead and grateful for experiences like this that keep pushing me forward on my journey!
