Operating Systems Vulnerabilites

Vulnerability attack vector
The path or method an attacker uses to exploit a vulnerability in a system

Attack Vectors
The way a hacker gets into a system
EX: Phising, Malware, Unpatched Software, Weak Passwords, Drive-by Download, SQL injection, and Social Engineering
*Drive-by Download- A cyberattack in which malicious software is automatically downloaded to a user's device without their knowledge or consent- often by visiting a compromised or malicious website
*SQL Injection- A Vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.  It allows attackers to View, Modify, or even Delete data without proper authorization


VULNERABILITY TYPES:

Legacy Systems
Outdated system, continue to use despite its shortcomings

End of Life (EOL) Systems
Vendor publicly declares as no longer supported 
Manufacturer STOPS selling and developing a product

End of Service Life (EOSL) Systems
Manufacturer STOPS all support, even security updates and customer service
NO MORE:
Technical Support
Security Patches
Spare parts (for Hardware)


Abandonware
Software (like old games or programs) that is No longer sold, supported, or updated by its original developer or publisher



VM escape
Vulnerability where an attacker breaks out a virtual machine (VM) and gains access to the host system or other VMs running on the same test 


VM Sprawl
When an organization creates too many VMs WITHOUT proper control, tracking, or purpose
Leading to Waste, Confusion, and Security Risks
