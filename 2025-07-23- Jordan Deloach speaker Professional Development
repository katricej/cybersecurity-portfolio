Guest Speaker Reflection 


Jordan A. DeLoach


Today our class had the incredible opportunity to hear from Jordan A. DeLoach, founder of the nonprofit Bridge-IT, who shared a powerful and refreshing perspective on the intersection of art and technology.

Jordan introduced us to an innovative and inclusive approach that blends STEM and the arts, helping those who might not see themselves as traditionally “creative” find their place in both worlds. His message resonated deeply with me:

Art can be a gateway to discovering new ways to think, solve problems, and connect with the world — especially within the tech space.

What stood out most wasn’t just his confidence in his own work, but his commitment to helping us — the next generation of tech and cybersecurity professionals — build confidence in ourselves. He emphasized the importance of networking and forming genuine relationships to unlock opportunities in tech, a reminder that success is rarely built in isolation.

One highlight was the tessellation artwork he brought in — a stunning fusion of geometric precision and artistic expression. It was a tangible example of how creativity lives at the heart of tech, and it challenged me to start exploring my own creative side more intentionally.

Grateful for the insight, motivation, and inspiration.
Today was truly energizing.
