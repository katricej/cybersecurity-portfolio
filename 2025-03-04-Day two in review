Today our discussion focused around The Seven Essential Life Skills.  Techinical was at the top of the list, but officially the list included Discipline, Curiosity, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Grit, Agency Under Duress, and Humility.  Throughout our discussion I think the essential skills that kept coming up as key skills were Critical Thinking and Collaboration.  I think these two skills go hand in hand because they complement each other in the problem-solving and decision making process. Critical thinking involves analyzing information, asking questions, and evaluating different perspectives to reach a conclusion.  Collaboration also involves listening and evaluating different perspectives, which ultimately also brings the ideas together to eventually lead to a conclusion.  
We also began to discuss the Mental Model and how this helps shape our perspectives and decisions.  It was a great day of learning and reflection.
