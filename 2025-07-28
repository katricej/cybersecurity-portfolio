Vulnerability Identification Methods

Vulnerability
A WEAKNESS of Flaw in the system software or network that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access

Vulnerability Scanning/Testing
Attack from the INSIDE of network looking for weaknesses
Usually done after finding something 
REACTIVE
Minimally Invasive (EX: Port Scan/Nessus)



Penetration  "Ethical Hacking"
Simulated Cyberattack Testing OUTSIDE
Mimicking real-world attacks
REACTIVE


Threat Hunting 
Process of searching through system, networks, and data to detect and isolate threats
PROACTIVE
Investigation--->> Reactive
Hunt------------>> Proactive

Use: 
IoC- Indicator of Comporomise
IoA- Indicator of Attack
Vulnerability Scan

Use Tools:
XDR
SIEM
UBA
Infuse with AI


Credentialing- Authenticating

Non-Credential Scan
Running scan without login rights to host OS or application


Credential Scan
Running scan/tests with login rights to host


Fuzzing
A way to test software by feeding it RANDOM or Broken inputs to see if it crashes or misbehaves

Indicator of Attack (IoA)
Sign that attack is CURRENTLY happen or About to Happen
Before the damage is done

Indicator of Compromise (IoC)
"Breadcrumbs"
Piece of evidence that shows a security breach may have happened
EX: Files, Unknown User Account, Questionable Traffic, Location (GPS), Rough Devices



Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Analyzes your source code, WITHOUT running program
Just looking at lines of code to find vulnerabilities


Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
Tests a running application by sending various malicious or unexpected inputs to see how it reacts

Threat Data
Static signature tools collect data

Reputation Threat Intelligence
Associates indicators of compromise (IoC)
Reputation data

Behavior Threat Intelligence
Deals with behaviors and patterns





Penetration Testing:

Rules of Engagement (ROE)
Whats Permitted and NOT Permitted 
Use contracts to explain rules
Agreement between 3rd party and company


Black Box
Testers Have NO INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE of the system 
Simulate real-world attack from OUTSIDE (External Testing)

White Box
Testers have FULL KNOWLEDGE of the system (source code, credentials)
Deep Security Audit/Code level analysis and FULL TRUST Scenarios

Gray Box
Testers have LIMITED knowledge, such as user credentials or network maps
Simulates an attacker with some knowlege (Employer or Compromised user)
Best for Internal Testing


Red Team
Simulates Real-world attacks
OFFENSIVE Security
EX: Social Engineering, Exploiting Misconfiguartion, Gaining Unauthorized access


Blue Team
Defend against attacks Monitor and Respond
DEFENSIVE security- Goal to Detect, Prevent and Respond to attacks
EX: Monitor logs, Incident Response, Patch Management, Threat Hunting

Purple Team
Bridge the gap betweeen Red and Blue teams
Collaboration and Improvement
Make sure Red Team findings Improve Blue Defenses
Lessons are learned and security keeps improving




National Instisture of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Create standards and guidelines and best practices to help organizations secure their systems and data

Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)
Non-profit focused on improving software security
Web based (Web and Application)


Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
Public list of known Cybersecurity vulnerablities

MITRE
Non-profit organization maintains CVE database 
Created the ATT&K framework- used in Threat Hunting
