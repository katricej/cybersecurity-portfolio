Backup Types and Data Protection

Differential Backup
- Status of archive attribute before including File/Filter.  
- Backs up all files changed since the last full backup.  
- Faster than full backup but not as comprehensive.  
- Backs up data changed since the last **FULL** backup.  

Full Backup + Last Differential = Complete Backup 
- Discarding = Review.  

Advanced Data Protection Methods
1. **Snapshots**  
   - Method of backup while files are open.  
   - Common for cloud environments 
   - Enables instant recovery of an entire system.  

2. File Mirrors  
   - Reflects changes on one side to another.  

3. Replication 
   - Creates and maintains an exact copy of data on different storage/locations.  
   - Asynchronous Replication:  
     - Data written to replica after being written to primary.  
     - Not real-time; occurs on a scheduled basis.  
     - Ideal for low bandwidth and long distances.  
   - Synchronous Replication:  
     - Data written simultaneously to primary and replica storage.  
     - Failover is instantaneous.  
     - Requires high bandwidth.

Data Disposal and Asset Management  

Asset Disposal 
- Secure and compliant handling of data and storage devices at the end of their lifecycle.  

Decommission Policy 
- Plan for removing unused IT assets:  
  - Hardware: Secure disposal (e.g., physical destruction).  
  - **Software/Apps**: Uninstallation and data wiping.  

#### **Data Destruction Methods**  
1. **Degaussing**  
   - Magnetically destroys stored data. Highly reliable.  
2. **Physical Destruction**  
   - Drilling, shredding, or damaging drives.  
   - **Highly reliable** for ensuring data irrecoverability.  
3. **Encryption**  
   - Protects data but requires key management.

Backup Strategies 

On-site Backups 
- Data is immediately available.  

Off-site Backups  
- Data stored remotely for disaster recovery.  
- Can be performed anywhere.  

Backup Types  
1. Full Backup 
   - Complete copy of all data.  
   - Disadvantage: Largest storage requirement and longest restoration time.  
2. Incremental Backup  
   - Backs up only files changed since the last backup (full or incremental).  
   - Faster but requires a full backup for restoration.  

Protecting Backup Data
- Use encryption with a recovery key for secure restoration.

IT Infrastructure and Security

SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN)
- Manages and connects office locations over the internet.  
- Optimizes traffic routing, saves costs, and enhances security.  

Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Software-based computers running on a physical host.  
- Isolated, portable, and uses virtual hardware.  
- Managed by a hypervisor.  

Zero Trust Security  
- Principle: "Never trust, always verify."  
- Focuses on protecting individual resources rather than network boundaries.  
- Assumes no device, user, or service is inherently trusted, regardless of location.  

Asset Management 
-Asset Classification: Organize based on value, sensitivity, and criticality.  
- Asset Tracking: Includes inventory, enumeration, and reporting.  

Microservices/FaaS (Function as a Service) 
- Small, focused services that perform single tasks.  
- Independent, communicate via APIs (e.g., REST).  
- **Benefits**:  
  - No server management (handled by cloud).  
  - Auto-scales based on demand.  
  - Pay-per-use pricing model.

OT (Operational Technology) vs. IT  
- IT: Tolerates latency (e.g., slow response times).  
- OT: Deterministicâ€”tasks have predictable execution times. No latency allowed.
