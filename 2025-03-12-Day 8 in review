Today was our first Professional Development day, and it was filled with valuable insights from Mr. Cofield and guest speaker Mr. Paul Farley. Both shared great advice that I’ll be reflecting on moving forward.
One of the most impactful moments was the focus exercise where we narrowed down what’s truly important to us. This exercise helped me understand how these values tie into finding my “Why,” something I had previously struggled to express without getting too long-winded.
I also appreciated Mr. Cofield’s emphasis on being proactive. He made it clear that it’s up to us to take action and make things happen. Mr. Farley’s advice about staying curious and being accountable resonated deeply with me. When you’re curious, you constantly seek to understand why things are the way they are and how they work. This really highlighted the importance of continually learning and pouring into yourself.
In the second half of the day, we focused on the importance of understanding the do’s and don’ts of professional business attire. It’s clear they’re preparing us for success in a professional setting, emphasizing that these soft skills are just as crucial as our technical expertise.
Overall, today was a great reminder of how valuable these professional development days are. They offer us the unique opportunity to meet and interact with people we might not otherwise have the chance to, in such a personal and direct way. It was a productive day, and I’m looking forward to what’s next!
