Network Address Translation

Network Address Translation (NAT)- 
Allows private network to connect to the Internet without using registerd addresses for each host/node
Translating Private address to Public Addresses
Advantages: Improves Security, Conserves IPv4 address space

4 TYPES OF NAT

1-    STATIC NAT (SNAT)
One Private IP address is PERMANENTLY mapped to one Public IP address
Deals with Inbound traffic
NEVER CHANGES!!
"ONE TO ONE"
Limited number of leases/ IP Addresses

2-    DYNAMIC NAT (DNAT)
Private Ip address are mapped to Public Ip address from a pool, BUT the mapping CHANGES and is NOT FIXED
"POOL"

PORT ADDRESS TRANSLATION (PAT)
Allows MANY devices on a private network to SHARE a single public Ip address.
"MANY TO ONE" 
Random numbers
Uses Port Numbers- EX: HTTP Port 80, HTTPS Port 443

PORT FORWARDING
A way to allow External Devices to services on a Private Network.
Incoming Traffic- "Outside world coming IN"

Edge Router
Edge Router is located at the Boundary of a network that connects to External Networks (EX: The Internet)
Manages the Flow of Data between the Internal and External networks

TYPES OF EDGE ROUTERS
CUSTOMER EDGE (CE) AND PROVIDER EDGE (PE)

Customer Edge (CE)
Customer Edge is located at the edge of Customers Network
Connects Internal Network to Providers Network
Security Barrier for Customers Network

Providers Edge (PE)
Providers Edge is located at the edge of a Providers Network
Maintain Integrity and Confidentiality of a Customers Data as it travels across the Providers Network
