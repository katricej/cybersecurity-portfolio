Today marked our second Career Development Day, and it was filled with insightful lessons and personal growth. Mr. Cofield kicked things off with an Enneagram assessment, giving us a deeper look into our personalities. I have to say, I agreed with my results! What really surprised me was learning that my assessment type matched a fellow classmate I had always considered my opposite. It was a great reminder that we shouldn’t assume too much about others. We may have more in common than we realize.
Later, we had the privilege of hearing from a former student, Mr. Donevon Howard. He brought a real perspective to the class, sharing his journey and the personal struggles he faced while in the program. There were a few of his struggles that resonated with me. His story of perseverance, hard work, and ultimate success was both inspiring and motivating.
The final part of the day focused on making meaningful connections, mastering networking events, and becoming comfortable with our elevator pitches. The role play exercises were insightful, and I noticed that for me the more natural and unscripted my introductions were, the better they flowed. Trying to deliver a “perfect” pitch sometimes made it sound robotic. I’ve realized that my strength lies in organic conversations and being myself is what truly makes me shine.
All in all, today was another powerful step in our career development journey! Looking forward to what’s next.
