Today, we had the opportunity to hear from Tomas Montilla, director of integrated cybersecurity architecture at Cox Automotive. He shared his career journey and valuable insights into breaking into the cybersecurity field.

What stood out most to me was how he got started in cybersecurity—not through a direct plan, but almost by accident. He explained that he hadn’t initially set out to pursue a cybersecurity career, but his path evolved as he took on roles in identity management, compliance, and security risk management. His experience reminded me that sometimes it’s not about landing your ideal role right away, but about getting your foot in the door and growing from there.

He emphasized that many of his career moves were lateral, not upward, but they built a strong foundation that eventually led to leadership. That was an important takeaway: it’s not always about where you start, but where you’re capable of going.

Thomas also gave some fantastic advice for those trying to enter the cybersecurity field:
	•	Understand the basics
	•	Get hands-on experience
	•	Think like an attacker
	•	Stay current with trends
	•	Soft skills matter
	•	Be specific in your goals
	•	Network and get involved

One thing that really resonated with me was when he said: “Never underestimate your ability to add value.” As someone entering the field with no experience, I’ve sometimes questioned how I could contribute. His words reminded me that fresh perspectives matter—entry-level candidates bring new energy and ideas that can be just as impactful as seasoned professionals.

He also suggested entry-point roles to consider, such as help desk support, consulting, audit, and compliance. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of knowing tools like Excel, PowerPoint, and the Microsoft Office suite—skills that are valuable in nearly any cybersecurity role.

In the second portion of our session, we were joined by Jennifer Denning, a representative from On The Rise, who spoke about credit. She provided in-depth information—some that I already knew, and much more that I learned. I appreciated how open she was to questions and how willing she was to share advice. Her insights were incredibly helpful for better understanding personal finance and building a strong credit foundation.

Today’s session was full of motivation, knowledge, and practical advice. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn from professionals who are so passionate and transparent about their experiences.
