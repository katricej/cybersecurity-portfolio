Today, we had the honor of welcoming Jason Zabek to speak with our class. With over 30 years of experience in cybersecurity, Jason brought a wealth of knowledge, insight, and practical advice from his time in the industry. He began his career in networking and spent 25 years at Cox, as well as working with other companies like NCR.

Jason emphasized a few great entry points for those just starting out in cybersecurity. One of the top areas he recommended was incident response. He noted that it’s a 24/7, 365-day-a-year kind of job and often serves as the front line for cyber threats. While it’s a demanding and fast-paced environment, it offers valuable hands-on experience. Other areas to consider include vulnerability management, auditing, and SOC operations.

Throughout his talk, Jason reminded us to take our work seriously, but not so seriously that we forget to take breaks and maintain a sense of humor. Cybersecurity is a team effort, and that means being open to many different ideas and ways of thinking. He said that 80–90% of the job can be routine, so knowing your role inside and out is key, but growing new skills will help you move into other positions as your career evolves.

One message that stood out was the importance of your “why.” Jason cautioned against choosing this path just for the money. Instead, he encouraged us to find purpose in helping others. That message resonated deeply with me. I remember being a victim of cybercrime, and it inspired me to pursue a career in cybersecurity so I could protect others and help prevent similar experiences.

He highlighted the importance of learning tools like Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Google Chronicle, and encouraged us to take advantage of training opportunities and certifications. Investing in yourself, even if it costs money, is always worth it. Experience can also come from volunteering, shadowing professionals, or pursuing internships. These not only build your résumé but also expand your knowledge and network.

When it comes to interviews, Jason shared some useful advice. It’s okay not to know everything. A better approach is to say that while you haven’t had a particular experience yet, you’re willing and eager to learn. Confidence is key. Research the company, be prepared, and if the interview doesn’t go as planned, don’t be afraid to ask for feedback to improve for the next opportunity.

He offered many tips about job searching, tailoring your résumé with relevant keywords, and creating versions of it for different job descriptions. But the message he repeated most was simple and powerful: don’t stop, don’t give up. The determined will always win in the end.
