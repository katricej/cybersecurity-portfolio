Wireless Troubleshooting


Wi-Fi 
Uses similar frame and MAC as Ethernet
Characteristics:
Logical star topology
Can easily add hosts without increasing administration
AP easily connected to a wired network, allowing clients to access both wired and wireless hosts
Placement and configuration of APs require planning to implement effectively



Service Set Identifier (SSID)
“Network Name” that wireless devices use to connect to a WLAN
It groups wireless devices together into the same logical network
32 byte unique character string identifies AP
Transmitted in the beacon frame and probe response frame
SSID sometimes called ESSID or BSSID; however, they are technically different
SSID often contains name of manufacturer and even AP model number
Disguise the nature of the network identified by SSID to avoid providing hacking
 Example: Accounting Department SSID = “Acctg"


 Basic Service Set (BSS)
 Group of stations (STA) sharing an Access Point
 Defines most basic infrastructure (“CELL”)
 Devices in BSS use same frequency channel
 • STA (station)
 Wireless NIC in end device (laptop, PDA, smartphone)
 STA often refers to the device itself, NOT just the NIC
 BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)
 Virtual MAC address derived from AP’s radio
 Uniquely identifies APs within a WLAN
 48-bit unique identifier for the group of stations that share an AP
 BSSID and SSID are not the same thing


 Extended Service Set (ESS) and Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID)

Extended Service Set (ESS)
 Multiple BSSs with Distribution System (DS)
 
Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID)
Network name for multiple BSSs within larger WLAN 
Group of BSSs configured with same SSID and security information
Allows a seamless network experience across multiple BSSs (“roaming”)
Represents all BSSs under one network name
Uses the same format as SSID

Range and Signal Strength
Range and signal strength play in Wi-Fi connectivity

 Wi-Fi Range
 Indoor range ~ 30m (100ft)
 2.4GHz has greater range than 5GHz
 802.11n + has greater range than older standards

 Dynamic Rate Switching (DRS)
 Adjusts data rates based on signal quality
 Strong signal receives higher available data rate
 Weak signal receives reduced data rate
 "The BETTER the signal, the FASTER the data moves"


Interference and Obstruction
 Solid objects and electronics REDUCE signal
 Thick walls, dense concrete, metal construction Fluorescent lights, microwave ovens, cordless phones, industrial equipment


Signal Strength
Ratio of a measurement to 1 milliwatt (mw)
Measured in decibel (dBm)
BETTER= Closer to 0 dBm 
IDEAL = -30 dBm
Good = -65 dBm 
PACKET LOSS = <-80 dBm


 Received Signal Strength Indicator - RSSI
Strength of a signal received by device from wireless source
 EX: How much power reaches a device from the signal
 Measured as a negative number; a smaller value indicates a stronger signal
 Use to measure signal strength at a given distance from the AP
 Device constantly checks the RSSI to gauge signal strength
 The stronger the signal, the better the connection
 RSSI: CLOSER to 0 dBm = BETTER

 Signal to Noise Ratio - SNR
 compares level of signal strength and background noise
 Ratio of signal power to noise power

Noise
 Unwanted signal
 Measured in dBm
 A number closer to zero is NOT GOOD


Signal to Noise ratio
 Higher values = clearer signals
 SNR higher than 1:1 indicates more signal than noise
 Farther a receiver is from the transmitter, the lower SNR
 If signal falls below noise floor, connectivity is lost


Heat Maps
 Show areas with a STRONG signal in GREENS and YELLOWS 
WARNING- ORANGES and REDS where signal strength drops off
 Visual representation of data
 Values depict color showing signal strength intensity in area
 Spectrum analyzer– measures wireless signal quality


Wireless Roaming
 Roaming
Device connection across APs without disconnects
STA  (station) moves from one BSS (Basic Service Set) to another within the ESS(Extended Service Set)without losing connectivity


 802.11r 
Also Known As Fast BSS Transition (FT) 
Standard that speeds up roaming between access points on the same network
“Fast Roaming”


Scanning
 Device periodically surveys surroundings for AP
 Methods:
 1. Active scanning
   Probe Request- STA initiates by sending special frame
   Probe Response- AP sends info STA needed to associate
 2. Passive scanning
   Beacon frame- AP advertises presence by sending special signal with information STA needs to associate

Wireless Distribution System (WDS)
Wireless Only Networks
Allows wireless networks to be extended using multiple access points without needing to connect them via a wired backbone
Allows Wireless Bridging (AP to AP communication)
Helps extend WIFI coverage in areas where running cables is difficult

Characteristics of WDS:
All APs have same channel, SSID, and security settings
All APs are configured in WDS/repeater mode
One AP set as base station
The other remote APs set as remote STA
Remote AP STAs forward all traffic to base station
Base station can be connected to cabled segment
No remote STAs will connect to cabled segment


 Hub-and-Spoke
 Centralized management and monitoring of APs
 Typically connects all APs thru wired link
 APs do not communicate directly with one another only thru the controller


Antenna use
Wireless signals travel without guidance
Whereas, wired signals are provided with fixed signal path
Wireless signals originate from electrical current traveling along a conductor
This electrical current travels from the transmitter to an antenna
Antenna emits the signal as a series of electromagnetic waves into the atmosphere
Another antenna (at destination) accepts signal and receiver converts back to current
Two antennas must be tuned to the same frequency in order to use the same channel


AD HOC
Small number of STAs closely positioned transmit directly to each other
 Works in peer-to-peer mode without Access Point
 Wireless NICs in STAs communicate directly with one another
