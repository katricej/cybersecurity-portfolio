We started the day with a reflection of yesterday's discussion.  Mr. Bricker asked us to write down key takeaways, and a few of the main things that stood out for me was Habits Create Discipline, and practicing discipline strengthens those habits. Mr. Bricker also emphasized the importance of taking breaks and getting proper sleep.  Collaboration was another big topic, focusing on communication, trust and the actions that come from working together.  
Mr. Bricker repeatedly stressed the need to be hyperspecific about what you want and why.  Understanding these things is crucial and being able to explain them is even more important.  
Later we went over five key practices for securing your information.  They included, Using a Password Manager, Use a MFA(Multi-factor AUthentication), Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network), End to End Encrypted email,and a Security agent running on the machine.
We had the opportunity to meet Pastor Deal, who shared the inspiring story of how he started the City of Refuge organization.  He explained how the organization helps people in need,and making a significant impact in the community.  Pastor deal left us with four key principles to live by, which were Be Prompt, Be Prepared, Be Passionate, and Be Present.  These principles served as a powerful reminder of how to approach life and work with purpose and intention.
We learned about the Habit Loop, which included four laws.  The four laws were Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy and Make it satifying.  
Finally, one of the most impactful moments of the day, and the one that made me reflect the most, was when Mr. Bricker asked us to create a statement that truly resonated with us.  The first thing came to me was  "I am a fighter because I have to provide for my family and create a legacy".
Today really made us think, reflect,and be hyperspecific about everything we did.  It was a day of deep learning and self awareness, pushing us to clarify our goals and actions.
