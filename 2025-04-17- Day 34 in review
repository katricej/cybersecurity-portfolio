Today was all about understanding the MAC Address, IP Address and the Subnet Mask

MAC Address
The Media Access Control or MAC address is a unique identifier assigned by the Manufacturer.  It is permanent and used only in a local network.  
The format is 48 bit, 6 pairs of letters and numbers

IP Address
The Internet Protocol or IP Address is a unique number that identifies a device on a network.  It is part of a range of numbers depending on the subnet mask or CIDR used with it.

Subnet Mask ("Network Mask" "Netmask")
Subnet Mask tells your device which part of an IP Address is the Network and which part is for the Hosts (devices)
Identifies the Network portion of an IP Address
Helps Devices determine which network or subnet it belongs
Dividing large network into many smaller networks
Each subnet portion has its own Network number, Broadcast number, and Host Address range

Why Subnet??????
Increase number of devices that can be added to LAN
Reduce traffic congestion
Reduce processing load on computers and routers
Isolate sensitive systems on the network (security)
Efficiently allocate available IP Address

CLASS          FIRST OCTET RANGE          DEFAULT SUBNET MASK
A                1-126                      255.0.0.0          /8
B                128-191                    255.255.0.0        /16
C                192-223                    255.255.255.0      /24
D                224.239                    N/A (UNKNOWN)     
E                240-255                    N/A (UNKNOWN)

SUBNET MASK            NETWORK BITS          HOST BITS            MEANING
255.0.0.0                /8                    24                  FIRST Part = Network
255.255.0.0              /16                   16                  FIRST 2 parts = Network
255.255.255.0            /24                   8                   FIRST 3 parts = Network
255.255.255.255          /32                   0                   All 4 parts = Network (1 Device only)

APIPA
Automatic Private IP Addressing range is a feature that allows devices to automatically assign themselves an IP Address when they cannot obtain one from the DHCP Server.
Used to establish basic network connectivity on the same local network segment.
APIPA address range 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
If IP address has a "169" in the number range its APIPA

Reminders: Private IP Address
Class A  10.x.x.x
Class B  172.x.x.x
Class C  192.168.x.x
169.254.0.1- 169.254.255.255 APIPA

CIDR 
Classless Inter-Domain Routing is a way to show how much of the OP address is for the Network
A shorter way to write subnet masks
Example: 255.255.255.0   = /24
Example: 192.168.1.0/25  = 255.255.255.128
