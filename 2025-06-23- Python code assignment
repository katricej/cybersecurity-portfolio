1.Kilometer Converter 
Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then 
convert that distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows: 
Miles = Kilometers * 0.6214 
 

kilometers = float(input(f" Enter the distance : "))

def convert_distance():
    miles = kilometers * 0.6214
    print(f"The conversion from distance to miles is: {miles}")

convert_distance()
          
 
OR 


def main():
    kilo = float(input("Enter kilo miles:"))
    print(kilo, 'kilometers converted to miles is ', convert(kilo))
    return miles

main()
          


 
2.How Much Insurance? 
Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or 
buildings for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the 
structure. Write a program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a 
building and then displays the minimum amount of insurance he or she should 
buy for the property. 
 


def insurance():
    replacement_cost = float(input('Enter the replacement cost of the building: '))
    minimum_cost = (replacement_cost * 0.8)

    print()
    print(f'Replacement cost : ${replacement_cost:,.2f}')
    print(f'The minimum insurance policy should be: ${minimum_cost:, .2f}', "(80% of the replacement cost)")

insurance()


OR


def main()
    total = float(input ("What is the replacement value of your building? "))
    replace(total)
    print("The minimum amount of insurance to replace ' , total, ' is', replace
    insurance = total * 0.80
    return insurance

main()
    


3. stadium seating 
There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats 
cost $20, Class B seats cost $15, and Class C seats cost $10. Write a program that 
asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, and then displays the 
amount of income generated from each class of ticket and total ticket sales 

def ticket_type():
    class_a = int(input(f"Enter number of Tickets sold for Class a: " ))
    class_b = int(input(f"Enter number of Tickets sold for Class b: " ))
    class_c = int(input(f"Enter number of Tickets sold for Class c: " ))
    class_a_income = class_a *20
    class_b_income = class_b *15

    class_c_income = class_c *10
    print()
    print(f"The total ticket for each class...")
    print(f"Total income of Class A tickets: ${class_a_income}")
    print(f"Total income of Class B tickets: ${class_b_income}")
    print(f"Total income of Class C tickets: ${class_c_income}")
