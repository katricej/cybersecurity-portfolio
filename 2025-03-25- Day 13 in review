Day in Review

Today was a rough day for me, not because of the material but because I seemed to have come down with a stomach bug. My stomach was a constant distraction all day, and I was pretty miserable, but I knew I couldn’t miss any class. I pushed through, determined to stay focused.

The class started with a review of virtualization, and for some reason, a lot of people struggled with that topic. For me, I think I understand the concept. I used a hotel analogy to help clarify it in my mind: Virtualization is like a hotel (the physical computer), the hotel manager (the Hypervisor), and the rooms (the virtual machines). If you want a specific room like a suite with a king bed, or a regular room with double beds, that’s how you can customize your virtual machine.

I had already downloaded my virtual machines at home, because technical difficulties on Tuesday when everyone couldn’t install theirs due to too many people trying to do it at once. Because I was able to successfully install all three of my Virtual Machines, I was able to help some of my classmates move along and get theirs installed.

We then dove into learning common Linux commands and their uses. I really liked that we were able to actually use our virtual machines during this time. Hands-on learning works best for me. It’s one thing to learn a term, but it’s much better to see it in action. The learning was a bit slow at first, mainly because it took us some time to get everyone on the same page. But the downtime allowed me to manage my stomach issues.

Overall, it was a productive learning day. I just wish my stomach hadn’t tormented me physically all day, but I was determined to push through, and I did. I’m planning to get some much-needed rest and start fresh tomorrow, ready to learn more. I also really appreciated the concern my classmates had for me today. They noticed I wasn’t my normal self, and it’s really heartwarming to see how we’re all becoming friends. That’s so awesome!
