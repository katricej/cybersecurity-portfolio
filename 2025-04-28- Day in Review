PORTS
Port- is NOT a physical connection 
A logical connection
Specifically determines which program or services on a Computer or Server

NETSTATE
Netstate- Network Statistics- Command Line tool that is used to display the current network connections and port activity on your computer
Can be combined with subcommand or switches 
Examples:
netstat -n
netstat -b
netstat -f

DHCP Server Port 68, 69
IP Address
Subnet
Default Gateway
DNS server

Assigns IP Address as a Lease
Lease- amount of time an IP Address is assigned to a computer
Must request to renew Lease or lease will expire

Reservation- Ensures that a specific computer or device will always be given the same IP Address
Typically given to special device or computers such as printers, servers, routers

Exclusion- Define a range of IP addresses kthat the DHCP server will never assign preventing conflicts with statiscally configued devices or other purposes 
Define a range of IP addresses within your DHCP scope that the server will not use for automatic assignments

DHCP RELAY
DHCP Relay- used when a DHCP client (like a laptop or phone) and the DHCP server are on different networks (subnets)
Forward Broadcast to DHCP server
Send DHCP offer to relay
Acts as a Proxy for DHCP server
An "IP Helper"
Router working as DHCP relay

Why Deploy a DHCP Relay???
A sercver may not be feasible, but want to use Windows server to manage DHCP
Better integration with other services
 - NAP  Network Access Point

CONFIGURING DHCP  
The DHCP Relay agent MUST know the DHCP server location (IP address and Route) 
The DHCP relay interface MUST receive the network broadcast

IPv6 ADDRESS INFORMATION
Uses SLAAC by default
SLAAC- Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is a method in IPv6 that allows devices to automatically configure their own IP addresses without the need for a centralized server like DHCP
Hosts ability to get address information by itself
Stateful autoconfiguration normally work on Client-server model

DHCPv6
DHCPv6- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
The version of DHCP specifically for IPv6 networks
Assigns IPv6 addresses to devices (hosts) automatically
Also known as SLAAC- allows hosts to self configuration their IPv6 addresses
Network Protocol for configuring IPv6 clients with IP prefixes and other information required to operate in an IPv6 network
Used when NO ROUTER is found OR If Router Advertisement message enables the use of DHCPv6
