Today was a fantastic and interactive day filled with teamwork and fun! We played a game called Spaceteam, which was all about collaboration. My class was split into teams, and our focus was on working together effectively. The day before, we had an assignment where we listed five attributes we believed were essential for a team in a collaborative setting. My attributes were communication, respect, accountability, open-mindedness, and reliability.

I ended up in the smallest group, and at first, one teammate felt this might be a disadvantage. However, in the end, it worked out in our favor, and we ended up winning the game. The game had no set rules, which we took full advantage of. Our team really thrived because we listened to each other, communicated openly, and tested out different strategies—even if some of them didn’t work. We embraced failure together, and that collective effort helped us achieve our goal.

This experience truly highlighted the importance of collaboration and clear communication in getting things done. Everyone brought something valuable to the table, and it was clear that each of us played a key role in the success of the team. Overall, it was an enjoyable and meaningful day that I thoroughly appreciated!
