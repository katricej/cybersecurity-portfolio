AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

Authentication- type of data used to create a credential (data to “prove a claim”)
 Factor types: 
 “Something you KNOW” – password; PIN; answer question 
 “Something you HAVE” – hard token; fob; driver’s license; smart card 
 “Something you ARE” – biometric: iris; retina; fingerprint; voice pattern 
 “Something you DO” – draw picture; signature on touchpad 
 “Somewhere you ARE” – physical location; IP_address

Single Factor Authentication (SFA) 
 Authentication by one type of factor (weak) 
  
Two-Factor (Double or Dual factor) Authentication 
Authentication by two different factors (better!) 
Subset of MFA 
  
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
 Authentication by two or more factors (best!) 
 Requires more pieces of evidence than 2FA to grant user access 

 Single Sign-On (SSO)
 Allow user to authenticate once to local device and authorized access compatible application servers without reentering credentials again
 Access multiple apps with one set of login credentials
Works by using Centralized Authentication Server (CAS)

Central Authentication Server (CAS) 
Centralized system that verifies user crendentials and control access to networked resources, applications, or services
A Key component of Identity Access Management (IAM)
Organizations can have hundreds or thousands of servers 
Purpose is to Authenticate
  Types: 
 --Kerberos 
 --Radius 
 --TACACS+ 
 --LDAP / Active Directory (AD)


Kerberos
Network Authentication Protocol designed to provide secure Authentication over an insecure network using secret key cryptography and a trusted third party
"Tickets"
Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)
Ticket Granting Service (TGS)

Digital Certificates & PKI Digital Certificate 

Digital Certificates- verifies/validate identity of ownership of online medium 
 --issued after a background check by authorized 3rd party 

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)- used to create manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke Digital Certificates and Public-Private key pairs

Certificate Authority (CA): 
3rd-party validates certificates 
Uses asymmetric encryption (public/private key pairs) 
Builds trust between user and org (certificate holder)

802.1X
A Network Access Control Protocol that provides Port-Based Authentication to secure wired and wireless networks
Controls whether a device can connect to a network by requiring authentication before access is granted
Appliance (switch, AP, VPN gateway) authenticates client before network access
Used to Authenticate a computer/device

Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) 
Most widely used opensource standard for Central Authentication Server (CAS) 
Provides AAA: Authentication, Authorization, & Accounting
Combines all three phases of AAA
UDP Port 1812/1813
Only the Password is Encrypted

Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) 
Provides AAA: Authentication, Authorization, & Accounting
Separates all three phases of AAA
Encrypts entire body of packet with TCP port 49 
Encrypts Username & Password 
Not backwards compatible
More Authentication requests and response codes

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
Allows users & apps to find info on people, files, software, devices, and organizations within network 
Also used to authenticate users 
“Directory Access Protocol” 
Generally transmitted through the HTTPS 
Use case: Storing Employee profile detatils (username/password) in database
Can be used with Kereberos to create SSO
Provides NO SECURITY; transmissions are in Plain Text
