Today Was the Big Test Day – And I Made It!

Today was a major milestone in my cybersecurity journey at City of Refuge—our Linux evaluation test, the make-or-break moment to stay in the program.

I came in calm and prepared, having spent the weekend reviewing notes, study guides, and past tests. I arrived at school extra early, checked in, and then took a moment in my car to reflect and reassure myself, I got this!! I felt confident in everything I had learned, and I have to give a huge shoutout to Mr. Darrell for teaching in a way that truly made the material click.

As test time approached, I could feel the nerves in the room, but I made a conscious decision to stay in my own space to protect my confidence. The test itself had moments where I second-guessed my answers (a lesson in trusting my first instinct!), but when it was over, I let out a huge sigh of relief.

What I wasn’t prepared for was the group meeting afterward. We discussed the pros and cons of the program so far. My biggest pro was how well Mr. Darrell explained the material.  I had some prior knowledge, but this was the first time I felt truly confident in it. The cons were the Classroom distractions, off-topic questions, and the occasional techinal difficulties slowed us down. But I was proud of myself for staying ahead, installing my VM's at home.  Because i went ahead and had my VM's installed before class I was able to help my classmates when things got chaotic.

Then came the nerve-wracking part, waiting to hear if I made it. We found out that it wasn’t just about a passing grade; there were other criteria. And I noticed that some people were in their meetings longer than others, which only added to my anxiety.

And then at the end of the day I got the news that I PASSED! I could have screamed with joy. I practically ran to my car to call my family, and when I told my younger son, he sang, “Go, Mom! Go, Mom!” That moment made everything worth it.

This journey is not just for me but it’s for my family, for my future, for the career I am building. I’ve proven to myself that I can do this, I AM doing this, and I WILL complete this.

Next up: Networking! Let’s go! I'M READY!!!!!
