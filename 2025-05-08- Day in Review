Authorization and Account Management
Network Hardening
Switch Security
Network Security Rules

Identity Access Management (IAM)
Identity- "Claim" "Admin"
Authentication- Prove a Claim
Authorization- Rights and Permissions
Accounting- Logging and Auditing

Access Control Model 
"Rights and Permissions"
Principle that govern how authorization works to give rights and permissions 
METHODS: 
DAC 
MAC 
RBAC 
Rule-Based AC
Attribute-Based AC

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
Access control based on owner of a resource every resource has an owner 
Owner (the Creater) has full control over the resource 
Decides who has access/ how it can be shared
Owner can modify the resource’s access control list (ACL) to grant rights to other users
Resource Types:  File, Folder, Printer, Webpage, Database
Owner can give read or write access to other user


Role-based Access Control (RBAC) 
Authorization is based on tasks the user or service must be able to perform 
Set of rights/permissions 
Each principal (user or service account) is allocated to one or more roles 
Requires all access thru the role 
User>>> Role >>>  Rights

Privileged Access Management (PAM) 
Approval Group for Admin
Checks and Balances for Root & Admin
 “Control  Elevated Access” prevent privileged account abuse 
 Policies, procedures, and technical controls 
 Prevent malicious abuse of privileged accounts 
 Mitigate risks from weak config control over privileges
Windows- Admin      Linux-Root


Least Privilege  
Granting users JUST ENOUGH Rights to perform their job and NO MORE


 Separation of Duties  
Establish checks and balances against possibility that critical systems or procedures can be compromised by insider threats 
Divide tasks prevents ethical conflicts or abuse of power
No Single individual has enough control or access to misuse a critical system or process on their own.
Its a way to prevent fraud, errors, and insider threats by dividing responsibilities among multiple people
"Checks and Balances" Each person is responsible for a different part of a process, so collusion would be required to bypass control



Zero Trust
"Never Trust, Always Verify"
Verify then Trust
Assume NO user, Device, or Application (Inside or Outside the network) should be trusted by Default.
Assume Breach

Implicit vs Zero Trust
Traffic Light Example  (Implicit Trust)              Untrusted    Untrusted   Untrusted
Untrusted    DMZ        Trusted                                ZERO TRUST!!!!!
Red          Yellow      Green


 Network Hardening

 Perimeter security- firewalls, screened subnets, proxy servers, etc.
 Create barrier at the network edge

Defense in Depth
Strategy to protecting assets from threats at multiple layers/levels instead of just one
Security controls (countermeasures) are deployed throughout network
If one layer is penetrated or is inadequate, another layer is in place to provide additional protection



“Defense in Depth” strategy 
  Comprehensive approach to protect an organization’s assets using  policies, procedures, awareness, and technical tools. 
 Physical 
 Perimeter 
 Internal network 
 Hosts 
 Applications 
 Data

Hardening 
 Apply secure configuration to each network host or appliance make each host & networking devices secure against tampering or abuse 
 Each host and network device should be hardened.  
HOW TO HARDEN DEVICES:
Change default passwords  
 Enforce password complexity/length requirements 
 Configure role-based access 
 Disable unneeded network services 
 Disable unsecure protocols 
 Remove unused applications 
 Patch systems regularly


Endpoint Security 
 Securing endpoints/entry points of end-user devices (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) from being exploited by malicious actors and campaigns 
 Uses security procedures and technologies 
 Endpoint security is enforced before the device can fully access the network

 MAC Filtering 
 Define which MAC addresses are permitted to connect to a particular port 
 Create static lock list of valid MAC addresses 
 Specify limit to number of permitted addresses 
 
Dynamic ARP Inspection 
 Validates ARP packets 
 Intercept, log, and discard ARP packets

Configure protection mechanisms (cont.) 
 DHCP Snooping- protocol checks ALL DHCP info that passes thru switch 

Neighbor Discovery (ND) Inspection & Router 
Advertisement (RA) Guard 
Switch inspects IPv6 packets with neighbor discovery messages 
Validates them against DHCPv6 table
