Our Professional Development Wednesday took us on an inspiring field trip to Napa, and I left feeling more motivated, informed, and grateful than ever.

From the moment we arrived, the hospitality we received from our host was unmatched. We were welcomed by an incredible panel of professionals, including a Global Senior Director of Cyber Defense, a Senior Software Engineer, HR representatives, and even someone from the GPC Legal Department. Each brought unique insights, but what stood out most was how genuinely they poured into us as aspiring cybersecurity professionals.

The presentation from the Cybersecurity Director was particularly impactful. He gave a detailed overview of the critical importance of cybersecurity and walked us through the safety measures and best practices that protect organizations in today’s digital landscape.

Following that, we had a long and rich Q&A session with the full panel. They offered advice that was not only solid but consistent with what we’ve heard from other mentors:
	•	Focus on your skill set
	•	Be prepared
	•	Stay confident, but lead with humility
	•	Act with integrity
	•	Be adaptable and always open to learning

When you keep hearing the same core advice from successful professionals across the board, it really reinforces just how important those values are. Personally, I pride myself on embodying these traits and continuing to grow in each of them.

A quote that really stuck with me came from one panelist who said, “You can’t get a rebound if you’re not around the rim.” It was a powerful metaphor about networking—staying engaged, staying visible, and putting yourself in positions where opportunities can come your way. Another memorable takeaway was the encouragement to not be afraid of saying “I don’t know,” but to follow it with, “Here’s how I’d find the answer.” That mindset is everything.

One of the biggest highlights of the day was during lunch, when I had the chance to speak one-on-one with a former student from the City of Refuge program. He answered every question with honesty and transparency, and I truly appreciated his openness.

I had the best day today. This experience confirmed that this is the kind of environment I’d love to work in one day.
