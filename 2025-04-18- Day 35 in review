IPV4 IPV6 ARP 

IPv4
Uses 32 bits
Allows about 4.3 billion unique addresses.
IPv4 addresses are running out, which led to the creation of IPv6.
Dotted Decimal Format/Binary Format
Written as four numbers (0–255) separated by dots.
Each number is 8 bits (called an octet)
IPv4 uses ARP to resolve IP to MAC addresses on local networks.
Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast

IPv6
128 bits
Hexadecimal Notation:
Written in 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
Uses multicast and anycast, but not broadcast
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) which means devices can automatically configure themselves without a DHCP server.
 
Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast, Anycast

Unicast: One-to-one communication.
"One-to-One"
Broadcast: One-to-all (within the local network).  "ALL"
Multicast: One-to-many (selected group) "GROUP"
Anycast: IP address, and the network routes your request to the closest one. Used by routers
"NEAREST"

ARP
ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.
It’s used to find the MAC address of a device if you already know its IP address.
ARP acts like a translator between IP and MAC addresses
Works only on local networks.
Uses a broadcast message to ask all devices.
Stores information in an ARP cache
