Remote Network Access
VPN

Virtual Private Network
Setup  a secure network inside another network
Network connection Encrypted from End to End
VPN often called "Tunnel"- Method encapsulates each Packet into new (Often Encrypted) Packet
Tunneling- Virtual Point to Point Connection

VPN Process: 1) Create Tunnel  2) Encrypt

Advantages:  
Annominity on Web
Able to Access Content

VPN Server
Assign IP Address (not your personal IP address but the VPN server IP Address
VPN encapsulates the data with an extra layer of protection
Enable you to access RESTRICTED internet content
Provides a secure connection for remote workers
Like a Proxy

Tunneling Protocols- PPTP, L2TP, SSTP, IPSec


Site To Site VPN
Connects two or more networks together securely over the internet
Used by Businesses with Multiple Office Locations
EX:  Company connects its NY and London offices as if they're on the same local network


Client to Site VPN
Uses a VPN client (app) on the users device to create a secure connection to a VPN server
Also called SSL VPN or Personal VPN

Hub and Spoke
Common Network Topology used in VPNs especially Site To Site VPNs
Hub= The central VPN server or Main site
Spokes= Remote sites or branch offices that connect to the Hub

Commercial VPN 
VPN for personal use Remote
Based on the Remote Access VPN


Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
Encapsulates higher-layer packets at Data-Link layer
IP packets for serial digital lines
Support several types of Network layer protocols
Provides NO security mechanisms (must use other protocols to provide security)


Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
Microsoft protocol once very widely used
Used with PPP to provide security
Has too many security flaws to be deployed safely

 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
 Works at Layer 3
 Encapsulate PPP, IP and other protocol as the payload
 IP Source Address and Destination Address GRE header, Payload




 Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) / IP Security (IPSec) 
 Best protocol for Mobile devices
 IPSec works at Layer 3
 Does not provide encryption by itself; uses IPSec

IPv6 uses IPsec (Encryption)
Comes with built in security if you enable it
Network Layer 3

Layer 2 Tunneling Procol (L2TP) / IP Security (IPSec)
Broad compatibility with older devices
IPSec works at Layer 3
Combines PPTP and L2F (layer 2 forwarding protocol)
Does not provide encryption by itself; uses IPSec


 Transport Layer Security (TLS) /  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
 Secure tunneling with certificates (EX: SSTP)
 Typically accessed thru web browser
 Encapsulate FRAMES or IP packets
 Functions at Session Layer; but adds significant overhead
 Transport layer security over TCP; Datagram TLS over UDP
Reminder- TLS Port 443 and think browsers when referring to TLS


Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP)
Sole development by Microsoft protocol; CLOSED source
Limited compatibility with other OSs
Relies on SSL/TLS for encryption
Developed as upgrade from PPTP and L2TP/IPSec


IPsec
Encryption protocol suite that defines rules for Encryption, Authentication, and Key Management for TCP/IP transmissions
IPv4 enhancement; auto imbedded in IPv6, operates at Network Layer
Adds security to IP headers and encrypts data payload
Requires regular re-establishment of a connection and is used with any type of TCP/IP transmission

IPsec Two Modes

Transport mode- secure communication b/t two hosts
 “End-to-End”
 Client To Client

Tunnel mode
 Runs on routers/other devices
 Communication between VPN gateways across unsecure network (Internet)
 “Router Implementation”



 Internet Key Exchange
 Part of IPSec that defines automatic method of negotiation and authentication



Split Tunnel- Remote client manages any Non-local traffic
Full Tunnel VPN Gateway manages ALL remote client traffic 



Clientless VPN 
Allows access to network resources via web browser
Does not need dedicated VPN client software
Uses HTML5's canvas element and WebSockets



 Remote Access
 Extend LAN over an intermediate public network (“Internet”)
 Remote system “joins” the LAN
 Enables remote control of computers and network devices
 Also known as “Remote Host Access"


Secure Shell Servers and Terminal Emulators

SSH
 Remote access to servers and network equipment

 Terminal Emulator/application
  Software that emulates a video screen or display
  Can run on the same host or remotely

 Secure Shell
 Secure terminal emulation over port TCP/22
 Connect to Linux, Switches, Routers, Firewalls
 Tunnel other traffic over SSH (secure file transfer)
 
SSH Server
SSH Server public/private key pair (“Host Key”)
Used to setup secure channel for the client to authenticate

SSH Client
Authentication Methods:
User name/Password (local database or server)
Public key authentication (User’s Public Key)
Kerberos – special TGT system
Ensure secure management of keys


 Telnet
 Protocol and terminal emulation sftw tool
 Assists the execution of remote commands and data
 Port 23
 Plain text/ NO SECURITY!!


Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
GUI remote administration 
Port TCP/3389

Out-of-Band Management (OOB)
Dedicated connection (wired/wireless) between host and network device (e.g. router, switch, firewall)
Used for secure device administration


Jump Box (Server)
Intermediary server securely manages access to other servers and devices in screened subnet/cloud network
Acts as an entry point
Secure computer that acts like a Gate keeper to access other computers on a private network

Jump Box Server Steps/Process:
1)  Connects to Jump Box Server - usually through SSH or Remote Desktop
2)  From the Jump Box Server you can safely access other servers inside the network
3)  It adds a layer of Protection Attackers can't go straight to important systems
