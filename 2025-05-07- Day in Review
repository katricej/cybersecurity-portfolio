Today, Mr. Ron spoke about a powerful concept called the Trust Formula. It consists of three components in the numerator which were Credibility, Reliability, and Intimacy. and one factor in the denominator, which is Self. Credibility is all about knowing your stuff. It’s built by being observant, taking the time to understand systems and processes, asking thoughtful questions, and seeking advice from different platforms within the company. Reliability is tied to being consistent, showing up on time, meeting deadlines, and following through on your commitments. If reliability ever wavers, communication is the strongest remedy. Intimacy, in this context, refers to genuinely caring about the people you work with. It’s about being someone who listens, shows empathy, and builds meaningful connections through shared interests like family, sports, or health. These conversations can naturally open up opportunities and help guide your career path. On the other hand, the denominator, Self, is something you want less of. It’s the part of trust that’s negatively affected by pride and ego. Being humble, letting others speak, and avoiding the need to show off or be a know-it-all is essential. Arrogance, in any form, is off-putting and damages trust.

Later in the day, we had the pleasure of hearing from a former student, Hadji Hicks. This was my second time meeting him, and just like before, it was a truly uplifting experience. His positive attitude is infectious, and his personal story from childhood to entering the program was incredibly motivating. It reminded all of us that if he could make it through and succeed, so can we. He shared practical advice about the cybersecurity industry, encouraging us to focus on tools that are useful in the real world, such as Microsoft Azure, Google Chronicle, Microsoft Defender Threat X, and ServiceNow. He also offered some deeply encouraging words: keep trying, do your best, and don’t be afraid to start over if you need to. We were fortunate to have him with us for the entire day. He gave us a glimpse into his current role as an application analyst and even helped us go over practice questions for the Network+ exam. His genuine desire to see us succeed was inspiring. I truly respect someone who takes time to give back, and I hope to do the same one day.
